Bill:  Thanks for the info.   I also spoke with Jeff about how 
EnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) 
is responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of 
Jeff's ""positions"" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  
Maybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.

Sara,

Please contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  
Rod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be 
available in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but 
I am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other 
things Credit support for his business.  

It does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without 
Treasury's approval.

Subject: Credit Derivatives

I am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in 
Houston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in 
the name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are 
backed to EnronCredit.com Limited.  

In particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ 
International Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have 
no master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit 
derivatives?

FYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.

men?

Zander called and suggested we attend the CCA crawfish boil function to be 
held Thurday May 2, 2002. Reasonably priced event, beer, mud bugs and we can 
sit back and watch pig win raffle prizes.

P.S. -- Dave, on your wish list you had included an evergreen provision.  See 
Section 2 of the original contract, which gives TW the right to extend for 
another five-year term by giving notice to SPS.  If TW does not give such 
notice, SPS may cancel the contract, and if it doesn't, the contract 
automatically rolls over for another year.  If this is not acceptable please 
let me know.

Rich and Dave, attached are my suggested revisions to Mike McLeod's draft of 
an amendment to the original electric service agreement.  Dave, I'll bring 
you a copy of that agreement.  Rich, if Mike did not send you one, let me 
know and I will fax it to you.  

In my revisions, I've attempted to reflect the least cost billing you 
described to me, using terminology I read in the tariff.  Please let me know 
if it looks alright to you.  I'm available to discuss this whenever you are, 
then I will make sending this to Mike top priority.  My sincerest apologies 
for the delay; there has been more chaos around here than I am accustomed to 
handling, and I appreciate your patience.

another five-year term by giving notice to sps.  if tw does not give such 
notice, sps may cancel the contract, and if it doesn't, the contract 
automatically rolls over for another year.  if this is not acceptable please 
let me know.

rich and dave, attached are my suggested revisions to mike mcleod's draft of 
an amendment to the original electric service agreement.  dave, i'll bring 
you a copy of that agreement.  rich, if mike did not send you one, let me 
know and i will fax it to you.  

in my revisions, i've attempted to reflect the least cost billing you 
described to me, using terminology i read in the tariff.  please let me know 
if it looks alright to you.  i'm available to discuss this whenever you are, 
then i will make sending this to mike top priority.  my sincerest apologies 
for the delay; there has been more chaos around here than i am accustomed to 
handling, and i appreciate your patience.

Hey Philip!

What's up? I have mixed feeling about you going to
ND...I', jealous! This year is out for me
unfortunately.  I have some friends that have gone to
games this year...I'll get the skinny on scalping.  It
shouldn't be much of a prop.  However, despite there
records, it's still ND and Tennesse. It will be sold
out.  But you can get tix.  I know this much. You
can't (or it's against school policy to )get tix on
campus. However, there are plenty of scalper on roads
leading to campus.

Sites to see.  Definietly check out the campus.  Make
time to see the lakes, go by the dome etc. It's
awesome. Also, it may be one of the games of the
week...so, look out for espn, nbc and all the rest.
The hype is great when networks other than nbc show.
Lots of small bars...avoid the linebacker, unless you
want to test that you have the endurance you had in
undergrad. College Football Hall of Fame is
there...downtown.  Tailgating is great....like I said
make sure you get to the game early. That way you'll
get the whole experience. Lots of tradition game day,
for example the Band marches from the dome to the
stadium....it's awesome.

I'll give you a call at work..

Later,

Steve

Hello Vince, Stinson,

Thank you very much for hosting my visit at Enron. I had a
very pleasant time there, and I found the meetings very
informative.

As discussed during my visit at Enron, I am sending you below
a DRAFT of the letter that would be needed to get the program
in place and rolling, and start the students working on it.
It took a while to find out what the appropriate process was
and how the letter should be structured. Sorry for the delay.

If I may, I'd like to visit Enron again, sometime in August,
to define the research agenda more precisely and prioritize
the problems to look at. I'm in frequent contact with Giuseppe,
who is impressed by the environment there. We are trying to formulate
the research issues and problems to study, that would be of interest
to Enron.  The plan is this:

1) By August, Giuseppe will have been there for almost 2 months
and will probably have a relatively good understanding of the Enron problem
space.

2) I will work together with Giuseppe till August to formulate a set of
good problems of:
a) high practical importance
b) high innovation potential
c) serious scope.

3) I could  visit in August (say mid-August or so) to:
a) discuss these problems with you and get your feedback
b) prioritize the problems and evaluate their impact
c) make sure we're on the same page regarding research strategy
and execution path.

I hope we can fully set up the program at Stanford before then, so
that I can bring on board one more Ph.D. student to start his
doctoral work in this area.

I'm all excited about our collaboration. I am even thinking of
starting a research seminar at Stanford, specifically on these
research issues!

Talk to you soon.
Best Regards,

Nick

as discussed during my visit at enron, i am sending you below
a draft of the letter that would be needed to get the program
in place and rolling, and start the students working on it.
it took a while to find out what the appropriate process was
and how the letter should be structured. sorry for the delay.

if i may, i'd like to visit enron again, sometime in august,
to define the research agenda more precisely and prioritize
the problems to look at. i'm in frequent contact with giuseppe,
who is impressed by the environment there. we are trying to formulate
the research issues and problems to study, that would be of interest
to enron.  the plan is this:

1) by august, giuseppe will have been there for almost 2 months
and will probably have a relatively good understanding of the enron problem
space.

2) i will work together with giuseppe till august to formulate a set of
good problems of:
a) high practical importance
b) high innovation potential
c) serious scope.

3) i could  visit in august (say mid-august or so) to:
a) discuss these problems with you and get your feedback
b) prioritize the problems and evaluate their impact
c) make sure we're on the same page regarding research strategy
and execution path.

i hope we can fully set up the program at stanford before then, so
that i can bring on board one more ph.d. student to start his
doctoral work in this area.

i'm all excited about our collaboration. i am even thinking of
starting a research seminar at stanford, specifically on these
research issues!

talk to you soon.
best regards,

nick

Nevada PUC Acts To Change Or Void Long-Term Pwr Contracts 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The Nevada Public Utilities Commission Wednesday voted to allow its General Counsel Office to take any action necessary to try to void or renegotiate long-term electricity contracts entered into by the state's two largest utilities, a PUC spokeswoman said. 
The contracts would force Sierra Pacific Resources' (SRP) utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power Co. to pay a higher price for power than current market rates, said Don Soderberg, PUC chairman. 
""We paid high prices when the prices were high, but to pay high prices when the prices are low is outrageous,"" Soderberg said. 
No one at Sierra Pacific or Nevada Power was available to comment on which companies have signed contracts with the utilities, or the value of the contracts. 
The PUC action follows a letter sent by Gov. Kenny Guinn to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in early October asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts. 
The General Counsel's office will now have authority to file with FERC and in court to plead against the current contracts. 
Sierra Pacific has said that a June FERC order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company. Sierra Pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices, only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices, the company has said. As well, if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market, it will now receive less for that power under the cap, it has said. 
California 's Public Utilities Commission is also pushing for renegotiation of $43 billion in long-term contracts signed by the state, which has been buying power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities since January. ",jeff.dasovich@enron.com,"fyi.

My thoughts for the trip:

Friday:

Everyone says that you have to see the zoo if you are in San Diego.  Even- if 
you don't particularly like zoos.  Everything I read says that it will take 
at least half a day.  I say we hit that Friday morning through early 
afternoon.  Spend mid-afternoon near the hotel- beach area- suppose to be 
shopping, etc. near there.  Then go to the game.  When we get back that 
night- we can walk on the beach!

Saturday:

Visit Balboa Park.  See the Botanical Gardens, in other musuems/gardens in 
the area that look interesting.  If we aren't sick of seeing animals, there 
is suppose to be a wonderful Wild Animal Park that gives trolley or walking 
tours (the tours are only like an hour and a half).  After that- there is a 
ferry you can take across the bay to the Coronado Island to see the Hotel del 
Coronado.  It is suppose to be a really neat place.  Then- you we can finish 
the day in the Gaslamp Quarter downtown.  It is suppose to have a ""lively 
evening street scene"" and live music.

What do you think?  Let me know- so I can look up times that all of these 
open- if we are interested.

Attached below please find the cash flow/tariff increase study we discussed 2 
1/2 weeks ago at the Sunday DPC strategy session.  The study assumes a 
decrease in losses from 40% to 25% and an increase in collection efficiency 
83% to 92% from 2000-01 to 2006-07.  Further, it is assumed that only one 
block of DPC operates until 2006-07.  

Two scenarios based on average realisation are illustrated:

1. A realistic cash flow study and  accompanying tariffs.  Given the above 
assumptions and assuming there is no state subsidy in 2006-07, MSEB should 
have a cash flow deficit of R34 Cr. in 2006-07 when Phase II comes on line 
for sale to MSEB, given a reasonable annual tariff increase.  (See the tariff 
sheet in gray shaded area.)  The annual rate increases would be15% for LT and 
HT agriculture and LT public water works, a 10% increase for domestic, street 
lights and interstate sales, a 4% increase for LT industrial and powerloom, 
and 1% increase for LT commercial and HT industrial, public water works and 
railways.

2. The annual tariff increases needed for MSEB to break even with a 3% 
profit, assuming industrial and commercial classes are held flat, are 
detailed below.  (See the Tariff sheet in red.) 
 
 Domestic          8%
 LT Public Water Works    35.60% 
 LT Agriculture and Poultry   26% 
 Street Light     10.8%
 HT Agricultural & Poultry    26.9%
 Mula Pravara Electric Coop Soc.  24.30% 
 Interstate sales       6.5%

It is obvious that  even the more realistic scenario would require strong 
MSEB, state government and regulator resolve.

In a separate e:mail I will describe the cost of service study we have also 
developed for MSEB.

The best way to do this is by a side letter agreement.  That way we do not 
have to modify the existing document and only need to address the issue with 
those counterparties that raise it.  We can do the side letters from our 
office.  This needs to be coordinated with either me or Tana Jones.

Should Clickpaper create the new password ap and insert the language you sent 
or should we do a letter as an addendum to the password ap?

Marla -

I appreciate the patience on the Password issue.   I realize it has been a 
while since we first spoke about this point. 

I have reviewed the concern about hackers and Enron use of Passwords and the 
best we can do is insert language into the Password App. similar to that 
appearing in the attached document (which is the same type of language used 
in the ETA's).  It is intended only to cover the situation where Clickpaper 
personnel use the password or otherwise access the website, in an 
unauthorized manner, on behalf of a counterparty.  The language does not 
address the hacker situation as we place the burden in that situation upon 
the counterparty.

Finally, since the Password App. is a legal, electronic agreement, any 
amendments or modifications for a counterparty must come through my office or 
through Tana Jones ((x. 33399).  Accordingly, those counterparties who have 
raised the issue should call either one of us if further action is 
necessary.  We do not actually revise the form agreements, but do provide 
side letters indicating modifications to the form agreement.

Once again, please accept my apologizes for the delay.  Let me know if you 
should need anything further.

Steve,

Please review the attached confirmation letter.  In order to apply the 
system's automated signature for Dana Davis, I couldn't change that area of 
the letter, but all the other changes should be there.  I do not have any of 
the information called for in the ""Payments to Counterpary"" section.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions.

Larry,

Please give me a report following your fly-over of the route with Doug 
Cebryk.  I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are 
there.  Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most 
helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield 
portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will 
need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps 
of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, 
Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.

After we receive the ""fatal-flaw"" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - 
although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should 
be scheduled to expedite the project as follows:
1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, 
a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the 
project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, 
etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw 
analysis.
2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season 
reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental 
Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out 
soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). 
3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with 
the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, 
US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to 
introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources 
early in the process.
4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs 
strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with 
local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so 
the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news 
media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the 
project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or 
Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix 
area and for the Southwest.

I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events 
coordinated.  John Shafer

Gary,

Thanks for the email.  Here is my attempt to type out a response.  I hope it 
helps.

1.  It was a matrix organization.  The IT personnel reported into the Global 
Tech. group but we did that for communication and consistency  purposes 
rather than simply control.  They attended business unit staff meetings and 
the BU had a great influence in the review process and gave constant 
feedback.  It was vitally important for the ""customer"" to be happy and that 
the IT person completed the projects from the BU.  When it came to the review 
process itself, GT ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit 
had the greatest influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated.

2.  When Enron Net Works was formed, nothing really changed on the day to day 
working of the IT world.  IT (Global Technology) was folded into the newly 
created 5th business unit at Enron.  Remember Global Technology had more that 
IT alone.  We had an eCommerce commercial group, a principal investments 
group and was developing eCommerce or Technology origination roles developing 
around the world.

Philippe Bibi is the CTO for Enron and Enron Net Works.  He is in the office 
of the chairman of ENW with Greg Whalley, CEO and Louise Kitchen, the newly 
appointed COO.  Both LK and GW are non IT people.  There are many VPs on the 
next level that are IT executives.

3.  In a nut shell, Scott grinned when I told him of my 2 weeks experience 
and title as CEO with Enron's goal of becoming the largest B2B player in the 
world.  He chuckled and said something like, ""That sounds like Enron, it 
always looks at things differently.  He then stated that my CEO title and 
Enron's approach was very unusual but that it would be more common place 
soon,  as this was the way of the future and Enron was the first to recognize 
it and change its culture"".

4.  When i used the word cannibalize, I meant that if we didn't change the 
business ourselves, than our competition would do this for us.  For example, 
we were the leading trader of natural gas in the US by far but we initiated 
EnronOnline and completely changed the way we traded natural gas and did it 
for free.  Thus we cannibalized our own successful business even when it was 
going great.  We are looking at all of our businesses for changes like that.

Gary, I hoped that helped.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have 
any other questions.

Hello Mike,

Thanks for sending me those presentation slides. They are good background. And
thanks so much for meeting with Julia and me this week. It was most 
interesting
and helpful. I'm confused on a couple of points, so would you mind answering a
few more questions?

1. You said that after Enron created the Global Technology group, you ""seeded
people out into the business units, and the way we did that is we had those
people be totally accountable both to us and to the business unit head."" So, 
at
that point it was a sort of matrix organization, with IT people dispersed
thoughout the business units but at the same time accountable to a central IT
organization for things such as standards, is that correct?

2. Then, this spring when Net Works was formed, did those 1,500 IT people
essentially leave the business units to join a more traditional IT 
organization?
Roughly how many non-IT people, and of what types, are part of Net Works? Two 
of
the three top managers in Net Works are non-IT (from trading), correct? Does 
any
given IT person now still live in a matrix world with responsibilities to IT 
and
to a business unit?

3. For some reason, my recorder messed up and I couldn't decipher what you 
said
about Scott McNealy's reaction to your background, etc. at the breakfast. 
Could
you repeat that?

4. You said: ""We had to cannibalize our own businesses. So what I think you'll
see five years from now is that the IT world will look totally different."" 
What
did you mean by ""cannibalize our own business""?.

Thanks again.

Regards,
Gary Anthes

",mike.mcconnell@enron.com,"gary,

thanks for the email.  here is my attempt to type out a response.  i hope it 
helps.

1.  it was a matrix organization.  the it personnel reported into the global 
tech. group but we did that for communication and consistency  purposes 
rather than simply control.  they attended business unit staff meetings and 
the bu had a great influence in the review process and gave constant 
feedback.  it was vitally important for the ""customer"" to be happy and that 
the it person completed the projects from the bu.  when it came to the review 
process itself, gt ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit 
had the greatest influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated.

2.  when enron net works was formed, nothing really changed on the day to day 
working of the it world.  it (global technology) was folded into the newly 
created 5th business unit at enron.  remember global technology had more that 
it alone.  we had an ecommerce commercial group, a principal investments 
group and was developing ecommerce or technology origination roles developing 
around the world.

philippe bibi is the cto for enron and enron net works.  he is in the office 
of the chairman of enw with greg whalley, ceo and louise kitchen, the newly 
appointed coo.  both lk and gw are non it people.  there are many vps on the 
next level that are it executives.

3.  in a nut shell, scott grinned when i told him of my 2 weeks experience 
and title as ceo with enron's goal of becoming the largest b2b player in the 
world.  he chuckled and said something like, ""that sounds like enron, it

Please let me know if you have an interest and when you might be available and  I'll arrange for the conference room to be available.

Here's the solution I came up with. It will only take a few more minutes each 
day, but I think it will make the EOL summary more relevant. Please let me 
know if this plan suits you - 

1. You will continue to receive the same EnPower/EOL summary, complete with 
EES sleeves. If I take the EES deals out of this table, I have to adjust the 
total megawatts accordingly. This could end up taking awhile, and I'm not 
sure the effect would be worth it. Again, let me know if you agree, because 
I'd like this report to be as applicable as possible.

2. I will run the EnPower deal count, excluding EES deals. I'll compare this 
count to the original one to determine how many EES deals were done by each 
desk, then double that number - to account for both sides of the sleeve - and 
subtract. I'll enter the altered numbers into the graph, which should produce 
a more accurate rendering of the day's activities.

I think I made it sound more complicated than it is. Bottom line, this should 
solve the EES sleeve dilemma with little ado.

Subject: This was in the Miami Times this morning




By Leonard Pitts Jr.
                         Syndicated columnist

                         They pay me to tease shades of meaning from
social and cultural issues, to provide words that help make sense
                         of that which troubles the American soul. But
in this moment of airless shock when hot tears sting disbelieving
                         eyes, the only thing I can find to say, the
only words that seem to fit, must be addressed to the unknown author
                         of this suffering.

                         You monster. You beast. You unspeakable
#######.

                         What lesson did you hope to teach us by your
coward's attack on our World Trade Center, our Pentagon, us?
                         What was it you hoped we would learn? Whatever
it was, please know that you failed.

                         Did you want us to respect your cause? You just
damned your cause.

                         Did you want to make us fear? You just steeled
our resolve.

                         Did you want to tear us apart? You just brought
us together.

                         Let me tell you about my people. We are a vast
and quarrelsome family, a family rent by racial, cultural, political
                         and class division, but a family nonetheless.
We're frivolous, yes, capable of expending tremendous emotional
                         energy on pop cultural minutiae, a singer's
revealing dress, a ball team's misfortune, a cartoon mouse.

                         We're wealthy, too, spoiled by the ready
availability of trinkets and material goods, and maybe because of that,
                         we walk through life with a certain sense of
blithe entitlement. We are fundamentally decent, though -
                         peace-loving and compassionate. We struggle to
know the right thing and to do it. And we are, the overwhelming
                         majority of us, people of faith, believers in a
just and loving God.

                         Some people - you, perhaps - think that any or
all of this makes us weak. You're mistaken. We are not weak.
                         Indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot be
measured by arsenals.

                         Yes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and
we are in shock. We're still grappling with the unreality of the
                         awful thing you did, still working to make
ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect from some
                         Hollywood blockbuster, isn't the plot
development from a Tom Clancy novel.

                         Both in terms of the awful scope of its
ambition and the probable final death toll, your attacks are likely to
go
                         down as the worst acts of terrorism in the
history of the United States and, indeed, the history of the world.
                         You've bloodied us as we have never been
bloodied before.

                         But there's a gulf of difference between making
us bloody and making us fall. This is the lesson Japan was taught
                         to its bitter sorrow the last time anyone hit
us this hard, the last time anyone brought us such abrupt and
                         monumental pain. When roused, we are righteous
in our outrage, terrible in our force. When provoked by this level
                         of barbarism, we will bear any suffering, pay
any cost, go to any length, in the pursuit of justice.

                         I tell you this without fear of contradiction.
I know my people, as you, I think, do not. What I know reassures me.
                         It also causes me to tremble with dread of the
future.

                         In days to come, there will be recrimination
and accusation, fingers pointing to determine whose failure allowed
                         this to happen and what can be done to prevent
it from happening again. There will be heightened security,
                         misguided talk of revoking basic freedoms.
We'll go forward from this moment sobered, chastened, sad. But
                         determined, too. Unimaginably determined.

                         You see, there is steel beneath this velvet.
That aspect of our character is seldom understood by people who
                         don't know us well. On this day, the family's
bickering is put on hold. As Americans we will weep, as Americans we
                         will mourn, and as Americans, we will rise in
defense of all that we cherish.

                         Still, I keep wondering what it was you hoped
to teach us. It occurs to me that maybe you just wanted us to
                         know the depths of your hatred.

                         If that's the case, consider the message
received. And take this message in exchange: You don't know my
                         people. You don't know what we're about. You
don't know what you just started.

subject: this was in the miami times this morning




by leonard pitts jr.
                         syndicated columnist

                         they pay me to tease shades of meaning from
social and cultural issues, to provide words that help make sense
                         of that which troubles the american soul. but
in this moment of airless shock when hot tears sting disbelieving
                         eyes, the only thing i can find to say, the
only words that seem to fit, must be addressed to the unknown author
                         of this suffering.

                         you monster. you beast. you unspeakable
#######.

                         what lesson did you hope to teach us by your
coward's attack on our world trade center, our pentagon, us?
                         what was it you hoped we would learn? whatever
it was, please know that you failed.

                         did you want us to respect your cause? you just
damned your cause.

                         did you want to make us fear? you just steeled
our resolve.

                         did you want to tear us apart? you just brought
us together.

                         let me tell you about my people. we are a vast
and quarrelsome family, a family rent by racial, cultural, political
                         and class division, but a family nonetheless.
we're frivolous, yes, capable of expending tremendous emotional
                         energy on pop cultural minutiae, a singer's
revealing dress, a ball team's misfortune, a cartoon mouse.

                         we're wealthy, too, spoiled by the ready
availability of trinkets and material goods, and maybe because of that,
                         we walk through life with a certain sense of
blithe entitlement. we are fundamentally decent, though -
                         peace-loving and compassionate. we struggle to
know the right thing and to do it. and we are, the overwhelming
                         majority of us, people of faith, believers in a
just and loving god.

                         some people - you, perhaps - think that any or
all of this makes us weak. you're mistaken. we are not weak.
                         indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot be
measured by arsenals.

                         yes, we're in pain now. we are in mourning and
we are in shock. we're still grappling with the unreality of the
                         awful thing you did, still working to make
ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect from some
                         hollywood blockbuster, isn't the plot
development from a tom clancy novel.

                         both in terms of the awful scope of its
ambition and the probable final death toll, your attacks are likely to

                         down as the worst acts of terrorism in the

I am calling Anjam to give him a deadline regarding move to Houston.
If he decides to stay in Houston, you should meet with him to convey
the concerns regarding his performance.

Subject: Support for Exotica

All

Sharad's investigations of Exotica's status in London have turned up a very 
confused state of affairs. This isn't being helped by the fact that:
1. Anjam is rarely at his desk, and can't be found anywhere in the building.
2. When he is around he isn't willing or able to provide all the information 
Sharad might need to support Exotica.  
This is worrying since much of our business depends on the validity of 
Exotica's valuations.

Sharad will now request information from Anjam via email to leave a trail, 
and I want to alert you to the fact that Sharad will be cc'ing you in on 
these emails.  

If things don't improve soon, I may need to request some assistance in 
extracting this information from Anjam.

Many thanks,
Steve

The NYISO is reserving hour beginning 10:00 in the January 19, 2002

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hours beginning 0:00 - 11:00, 13:00,

the January 19, 2002 Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 20, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due

incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

Rogers --

Harry Kingerski informed me that you and some team members were going to visit ConEd to discuss the Benchmark Rate Swap.  I think it's a great idea (Scott Gahn and I had discussed something similar a few years ago when he ran URM).  

My only thoughts for you would be: 1) maybe difficult to do the swap with the Utility (given PUC oversight), but the Holding company should be in the same place financially and should be protected from PUC scrutiny and 2) being long T&D (assuming that you don't sell 100% of the position to customers) creates interesting regulatory questions.

I'd love to sit down with you to discuss this product.

      Ack!! Trying to catch up here after several days of vacation. 
Quite 
   a 
      meandering collection of emails.  You should get your tee shirts 
and 
   why 
      not go the whole 9 yards and get custom license plates... take 
pride 
   in 
      your losing streak!!  Unfortunately I don't think I can make the 
game 
      tonight, but Thursday or Friday for an xbox demo would be cool.

    Attached are the most recent blacklines of the Declaration and Bylaws of
the Midway project.  The Articles did not change.  These changes were made
after discussions with Chris Boehler and Greg Krause.  Please let me know if
I may now send them to Scott Williams.  The only thing he may object to is
the lack of strong language guarantying the operation of the storm water
system in Paragraph 3.2.

Dave,
 I will be glad to generate the form of Transaction Agreement; however, I 
have a number of questions.
1.  Relationship of Delivery Point and the use of Interruptible Transport on 
Northwest Pipeline.  Is the transport upstream or downstream of the delivery 
point?  If downstream, why isn't it being contracted for by EWEB.  
2.  What volume is being sold each day.  You use the term DCQ and you also 
talk about a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity.  Normally 
their would be no tolerance with a DCQ transaction.  
3.  Is this envisioned to be a requirements transaction.  Is the price the 
same for volumes in excess of the estimated quantity up to an additional 
20%.  Is no penalty to apply if the actual volumes are 0% to 20% less than 
the estimated quantity?  What if they take more than 20% in excess without 
making any arrangements for incremental gas.  What price is to be used for 
such non scheduled excess volumes? 
 Please call me regarding the foregoing so that I can start to work on the 
transaction agreement.

Dan,

The attached term sheet describes a gas sale we are proposing to the Eugene 
Water and Electric Board.  Please have a look and let me know how you think 
the actual confirm should look.  They have an Enfolio in legal review now.

>     Washington, DC 
> 
>     Dear Mr. President:
> 
>         We are writing because our constituents and millions of
> Americans across the West need your intervention at the Federal Energy
> Regulatory Commission (FERC) in order to address serious problems with the
> Western energy market. 
> 
>         As you know, California has been experiencing an electricity
> crisis that has resulted in blackouts throughout the state, inconvenienced
> millions of citizens and businesses, and disrupted the state's and
> region's economy.  Indeed, this crisis seriously threatens to cause
> long-term damage to the economy of California, the Western region, and
> perhaps the entire country.
> 
>         The crisis is the result of a dysfunctional energy market
> where wholesale prices of electricity have spiked exorbitantly.  For
> example, wholesale prices on December 15, 2000, ranged from $429 per Mwh
> to $565 per Mwh, compared to prices from $12 per Mwh to $29 per Mwh one
> year earlier.  Wholesale prices have jumped as high as $1400 per Mwh.  In
> fact, the California Independent System Operator (ISO), the state's power
> grid operator, has projected that electricity which cost $7 billion in
> 1999 will cost $70 billion this year.  These skyrocketing prices can only
> partly be explained by natural gas price increases and increased energy
> demand.
> 
>         These exorbitant price spikes have led FERC Commissioner
> William L. Massey to state on February 8, 2001:
> 
>         These high prices serve only to continue a massive wealth
> transfer out of the region.  Is it worth dragging down an entire regional
> economy, or perhaps even the national economy, for the theoretical purity
> of unfettered price signals?  I say no.  I call on my fellow commissioners
> to consider a time out now.  It's our statutory obligation. . . .  FERC's
> timidity  and hands-off approach is eroding consumer confidence and
> destroying the consensus that heretofore supported a market based
> approach.  
> 
> 
>         The dysfunctional nature of the market has apparently
> allowed it to be manipulated.  The California ISO last week presented FERC
> with findings of a comprehensive study of pricing data in California's
> wholesale electricity market over the last 10 months.  According to the
> Los Angeles Times, the ISO's study found ""evidence of market manipulation
> and consistent patterns of bidding far above costs"" and that ""suppliers
> commonly offered electricity at twice their costs.""  The ISO has estimated
> the cost of the potential overcharges between May 2000 and last month are
> high as $6.3 billion.    
> 
>         Unfortunately, FERC actions have fallen far too short.  To
> date, FERC has not aggressively worked to address market manipulations,
> despite finding last fall that wholesale prices were not ""just and
> reasonable.""  Nor is FERC apparently willing to seriously consider
> addressing runaway wholesale rates.
> 
>         The state of California is taking heroic measures, but this
> is an issue California cannot address alone.  In a February 28, 2001,
> meeting with the California delegation, FERC Chairman Curt Hebert
> confirmed the widespread understanding that the California market is not
> working.  He called the California market ""broken,"" and acknowledged the
> regional problems posed by the market.  Additionally, Chairman Hebert
> stated that ""I don't think there is any way California can pull itself out
> of this thing alone.""  As Mr. Hebert knows, California has no authority
> over wholesale electricity sales.  These sales fall solely within the
> jurisdiction of the federal government.
> 
>         Despite FERC's recognition that California cannot address
> this problem alone, FERC seems unwilling to assist California and the

> Massey's suggestion of a temporary cost-based price cap on spot market

economic hemorrhaging in the West.

        Mr. President, we request that you help protect California's
economy, and indeed that of the Western region and the nation.  Please
support the Governors' request on wholesale rates, investigate the recent
allegations of overcharges, and act to prevent a dysfunctional electricity
market from damaging our constituents and a major engine of the nation's
economy.

> perhaps the entire country.
> 
>         the crisis is the result of a dysfunctional energy market

>         these high prices serve only to continue a massive wealth

        mr. president, we request that you help protect california's
economy, and indeed that of the western region and the nation.  please
support the governors' request on wholesale rates, investigate the recent
allegations of overcharges, and act to prevent a dysfunctional electricity
market from damaging our constituents and a major engine of the nation's
economy.

us on the lateral.  Steve Thome had good luck with them on a water line and 
wanted to pass the name along.  He also called and mentioned a guy who is 
with an Enron affiliate - Northern Border - and is interested in a pipeline 
spur as well.  His phone number is 303-575-6479.  May be helpful to keep it 
in the Enron family.

Rusty,

Here is the contact for our pipeline contractor:

Clark Ashton
Rooney Engineering
1418 Millstream Lane
Salt Lake City, UT 84106

801-463-7981 

Clark is the business development guy.  He is well connected in the power 
industry (he used to work for NEPCo).  I believe Rooney specializes in 
pipeline installation - they certainly are extremely knowledgeable.  I 
suggest you contact Clark to find out more.

Kim,
 
I wanted to forward you this email that I sent to Vince.  He had come back to Richard and I to resolve an issue with the dropping VaR associated with TW.  Vince was asking if this was related to the processes that we have automated. In speaking with Vernon, the date of the ERMS problem with the San Juan basis discussed below happened to coincide with the date or near proximity of the unwinding the Wholesale positions that TW had held. Consequently, there were substantial changes with the VaR increasing during this period.  When the rolling price data dropped off, it rolls for 30 days, the VaR decreased substantially.  If you have any questions please give me a call.

Vince,
 
I left you a message concerning the issue with the VaR.  The problem is associated with the ERMS Price that came on December 19.  The basis was .23 instead of -.23.  This is represented in SJ Price Quote File below. Consequently the inclusion of this date in the rolling 30 day bucket for the Historical Volatility calculation essentially changed the volatility for the entire Winter 2002-2003 strip.  Any I-I deal involving the San Juan was thus flawed and shown in the VaR.  
 
As this did occur on December 19th, this should have been caught in the December time period for any VaR report done on a daily basis since that time.  For example, the San Juan Historical Volatility was .395 on December 17, .394 on December 18, .521 on December 19 and .657 on December 20.  The VaR went up in the same way it came down-- on Feb 4 it was .66, on Feb 5 it was .52, on Feb 6 it was .357 and on Feb 7 it was .343.  This is shown in the attached file San Juan Hist Vol.
 
As Richard and I do the base calculations, which are correct, we would never catch this mistake.  We are somewhat surprised that when this volatility was included on December 19th the VaR report did not show a substantial increase from the previous day.  In the same way the VaR dropped by half, we would have expected it to double over a period of a couple of days in that week of December.
 
All in all, this issue took 10 hours for Richard and I to resolve.  As it is essentially out of the perview of setting up the SAS automation process--the process did run correctly, it was a little frustrating for us to devote the time to identifying this particular issue.  It would also appear to be a troubling issue from a financial perspective given the current Enron environment. 
 
I hope this resolves the problem.

Hey Chris,

Jeff,

Diann Huddleson has spoken with PG&E on numerous occasions, and they have 
confirmed that effective as of January 19, 2001, they began using a Weighted 
Average cost of Generation/Purchase for the calculation of the PX amount.  I 
will coordinate between Tamara and the Services group which has this 
information and make sure everyone is on the same page.  I also support 
Tamara's desire to reconcile, at a tariff level, the curves to actual utility 
bills. 

Thanks,
Wanda

PG&E has changed the method of calculating the PX Credit recently.  Prior to 
June they appeared to be using a market based price for power, but in June 
the credit dropped to about $40/MWh which looks like utility-owned gen.

We want to make sure we are not missing a utility-levied charge in our 
forward curves ( e.g. CTC charge that will be applied to DA) so we're trying 
to verify the utilities' method of calculating PX credits.

I talked to the PG&E accounting person who said that their Regulatory group 
has sent Enron's regulatory group information on the way the PX Credit is 
calculated.  Can someone locate this information and forward it to me as soon 
as possible?  Given that our customers are all switching to DA we don't want 
to discover there's a charge we don't know about.

Houston, we have a problem

11/03/2001
The Economist
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economist; Source: World Reporter (TM) - FT McCarthy

The troubles of Enron, a Texan powerhouse in the energy markets, could result in a new financial crisis 
JUST last year, visitors to Enron's glittering headquarters in Houston were greeted by a giant banner that proclaimed the firm, ""The world's leading energy company"". That annoyed Enron's smaller energy-trading rivals, many of which have offices only a stone's throw away in Houston's Energy Alley, but not as much as what came next - a new banner, declaring Enron ""The world's leading company"". In recent weeks, as the company has been engulfed by a financial crisis, that banner has quietly been removed.
The heady mix of audacity, ambition and arrogance revealed by the banners is as good a guide as any to Enron's remarkable rise and fall. Forged in the 1980s by the merger of two troubled gas-pipeline firms, Enron drove the development of the sophisticated spot-and-derivatives markets in energy that it has come to dominate. Indeed, such is the scale of its operations, and its dealings with many of the world's financial institutions, that some observers see parallels with Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), the hedge fund that failed in 1998 - and not just because seemingly brilliant financial alchemists have been humbled. Were Enron to go bust - unlikely, but in the current nervous climate, not impossible - might a crisis ensue? 
Troubles in California's politically crazed power market, an ill-advised foray into telecoms bandwidth trading and concerns about management badly dented Enron's share price earlier this year, prompting the departure of Jeffrey Skilling, the firm's newish chief executive, in August. Kenneth Lay, an avid free-marketeer, friend of George Bush and visionary chairman of the firm, was obliged to resume hands-on control. 
This has not slowed Enron's decline. Day by day, it seems to be sinking deeper into a financial quagmire that is largely of its own creation. Not least thanks to its lack of transparency, the firm's credibility with the markets has eroded to the point that talk of a possible takeover or even bankruptcy is widespread. 
Enron's reputation for financial wizardry has been turned from an asset to a liability since its third-quarter results came out in mid-October, showing a $1 billion write-off on water distribution, broadband trading and other investments. Worse, disclosed only in passing by Mr Lay in a conference call with analysts, the firm suffered a $1.2 billion reduction in capital, stemming from a hedging deal with a related private-equity fund called LJM. The charge was due to Enron's forced sale of 55m of its own shares when the partnership was unwound this summer. Almost nobody outside Enron had been aware of the terms of the deal with LJM, a ""structured finance vehicle"". 
Enron's failure to offer details about the risks from other related partnerships have led many to fear the worst about its huge balance sheet. Its shares plunged by 19% on October 30th alone (see chart on next page), before recovering a bit the next day. 
Andrew Fastow, who was replaced as chief financial officer on October 24th, was a general partner in LJM. Jeffrey McMahon, his successor, has much to do to restore confidence. Questions abound. Were the trusts run at arm's length? What did Mr Fastow earn from the partnership? Ominously, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has now launched a formal inquiry. 
Moody's, a rating agency, last week cut its rating on the company's debt to barely above ""junk"" level. Further downgrades might unleash claims from other off-balance-sheet partnerships. Those known about, such as Atlantic Water and Marlin Water, do not seem big enough to bankrupt Enron, but speculation is rife about what other obligations might lurk secretly in other structured vehicles. 
A lower credit rating could destroy Enron's core franchise as the leading energy middleman, by scaring away customers and freezing the wholesale energy markets. That might have nasty consequences in other markets. Enron acknowledges that it is a large participant in the derivatives market, holding a portfolio with a notional value of $21 billion. Rightly or wrongly, many traders believe that figure vastly understates Enron's presence. If the firms on the other side of Enron's trades start to fear that payment is not coming, they might curb their other trading, producing a knock-on effect. Where this could end up is a subject of much conjecture. 
Utilities that trade energy could be hit. So could the commodity and derivative operations of large commercial and investment banks. The ties are notably tight between Enron and J.P. Morgan Chase, according to Ventana Capital, a research firm. Not only does J.P. Morgan provide innumerable separate credit arrangements for Enron; it also has the largest derivative operation of any bank, as well as a large business trading commodities. There is ""no doubt"" that Enron is on the other side of many J.P. Morgan trades, says Ventana. 
Were Enron to fail, Ventana thinks ""it has the potential to cause a major financial crisis"", worse, in some ways, than what occurred after LTCM. That merely froze the debt markets temporarily, whereas Enron deals in the building-blocks of the American economy. Imagine gridlock in the markets for gas, timber, coal, metals, fertiliser, bandwidth or indeed any of the products Enron deals in. 
As yet, this all seems unlikely. Many big traders were happy to deal with Enron this week, although at shorter maturities and with less complex structures than in the past. Trading on EnronOnline was reportedly strong. Jim Donnell of Duke Energy, a big energy trader, described ""a huge dichotomy"" between the collapse in confidence in Enron in the equity and credit markets and the ""business as usual"" attitude taken by big commodity trading firms when considering Enron as a counterparty. 
Yet as questions about Enron's credit-standing spread this week, it began to have difficulty making markets in some instruments. Few firms would accept Enron's name as guarantor of a credit derivative. In its core energy markets some big trading counterparties refused the Enron name. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), two houses reportedly specified that they would not take Enron's credit. 
The biggest credit exposure appeared to be with banks, whose $3 billion of back-up lines to Enron were drawn down last week. J.P. Morgan arranged an additional $1 billion emergency credit-line this week. This back-up, it is widely assumed, is needed mainly to meet margin calls triggered by the ratings downgrade. 
Too big to fail? 
Is Enron too big and too important to be allowed to fail? Philip Verleger, an energy economist, thinks that Enron is so central to energy markets that it could not easily be replaced. Enron's rivals mostly disagree, unsurprisingly. 
But even Enron's worst enemies do not (yet) expect the firm to die from its current crisis. Most traders seem keen that it should live. ""Nobody likes to see a wholesale trader disappear,"" says one. They admire Enron's armies of traders and their ability to do deals. EnronOnline is one of the Internet's few success stories, assuming its huge trading volumes do indeed generate big profits, as the firm claims. 
Enron's, and the financial system's, problems could worsen if doubts grow about its ability to meet its obligations. On the surface it is rich in assets, if not cash. But its lack of transparency leaves uncomfortable room for doubt. In June 2000, The Economist challenged Mr Lay to reply to accusations of arrogance, high-handedness and a propensity to push the limits of the law. His response was revealing. To show that such charges were baseless, he pointed to another firm unfairly maligned by critics: Drexel Burnham Lambert, an investment bank that rose from obscurity to market prominence in the junk-bond boom of the 1980s. Drexel was accused of arrogance, he groused, but it was only being ""very innovative and very aggressive"". Drexel was not bailed out: Michael Milken, its star, ended up in jail, and Drexel collapsed in a heap of bad debts and ignominy.

Enron Gets $1 Billion New Credit Line, But Must Pledge Top Gas-Pipeline Assets
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. secured $1 billion in new credit lines, but had to pledge its best gas-pipeline assets as collateral. The deal did little to appease an important credit-rating agency. 
Standard & Poor's Ratings Group lowered its rating on Enron's long-term debt by one notch to triple-B from triple-B-plus and short-term debt to single-A-3 from single-A-2, citing a belief that Enron's planned sale of assets ""will be insufficient to restore its long-term credit quality"" to historic levels. Moody's Investors Service Inc. had issued debt downgrades earlier this week.
S&P also lowered ratings on the debt of Enron's pipeline systems, Transwestern Pipeline Co. and Northern Natural Gas Co., that were used to collateralize a $1 billion bank borrowing from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit. Enron said it would use the money from the 364-day credit lines to refinance roughly $250 million in maturing obligations, leaving it $750 million to boost short-term liquidity. 
In dropping the pipeline credit ratings by two notches, S&P noted that the assets have become ""more strategic to the company,"" in part because they can be relied upon to consistently make money, unlike many other Enron hard-asset investments. 
The pipelines produced $450 million in gas-transport revenue and an $85 million pretax profit in the third quarter on generally rising rates. That compared with revenue of $424 million for Enron's foreign assets that scraped by with a $19 million earnings contribution. 
Todd Shipman, credit analyst for S&P, said there have been concerns that Enron might take on too much debt, trying to prove it has enough cash on hand to meet its energy-trading obligations. But he said S&P wasn't worried by the most recent borrowing, because ""we don't think it will be a permanent part of the balance sheet."" However, he added that the amount of additional debt it can take on top of the $13 billion it now has outstanding is ""little to none."" With the sharp fall in its stock price, Enron's market capitalization is now around $10 billion. 
An Enron spokesman said ""it should be a nonissue"" because the company has no intention of borrowing more money anytime soon. 
In announcing the borrowing plan, Enron's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said it was a move to ""enhance investor confidence."" But stock-market investors reacted otherwise and Enron stock gave up most of Wednesday's gain, closing at $11.99, down $1.91, or 14%, in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. With many Enron bonds trading at two-thirds of their par value, bondholders didn't seem comforted either. 
Enron has been in a defensive posture since it announced a third-quarter loss of $618 million two weeks ago, followed by news that it also took a $1.2 billion equity write-down, based partly on transactions involving a handful of its own officers. The company replaced its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, after the Securities and Exchange Commission began an inquiry into related-party transactions. Enron on Wednesday disclosed that the inquiry had been elevated to a formal probe.

Enron's Shares Fall and Debt Rating Is Cut
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

11/02/2001
The New York Times
Page 11, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

DALLAS, Nov. 1 -- With investors absorbing news of a formal Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and a downgrading by another large credit-rating agency, shares of the Enron Corporation fell 13.7 percent today, giving back most of the gains from Wednesday's rally. 
Late on Wednesday, Enron, the energy-trading giant based in Houston, said the S.E.C. had intensified its inquiry into the company's finances, making it a formal investigation, carrying subpoena power.
And today, Standard & Poor's lowered its rating on Enron's senior debt by one notch, leaving it a few notches above junk bond status. The downgrading came after a similar cut by Moody's Investors Service on Monday. S.& P. left Enron under review for a possible further downgrading. 
If Enron's credit rating were dropped below investment grade, it could force the company to issue millions of shares of stock to satisfy debts and prompt other big energy-trading concerns to curtail their business with Enron. 
S.& P. said that the company's ''financial flexibility has continued to diminish'' and that it had been unable ''to calm investors that are unsure about the strength of Enron's core energy marketing business.'' But the rating agency also said it thought that ''Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty'' and that, so far, ''most counterparties have maintained their trading activity with Enron.'' 
This morning, Enron said it had obtained $1 billion in additional financing. The line of credit may help the company convince investors and trading partners that it can weather this crisis. But some industry officials said investors might have reacted negatively because Enron had to pledge assets from two subsidiaries, Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern Pipeline, to secure the credit line. 
An Enron spokeswoman said that she did not know what interest rates the credit lines carried and that the company had no plans to seek even more financing deals. 
Enron's shares have fallen by more than half in the last two weeks because of the S.E.C. investigation and worries about off-balance-sheet debts and transactions with investment partnerships involving the company's former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last week. Enron shares fell $1.91 today, to $11.99. 
Some analysts are beginning to attribute a swift recent rally in natural gas prices in part to the possibility that a collapse of Enron would roil the commodity markets. Enron dominates natural gas and electricity trading in the United States. 
In New York today, natural gas for December delivery fell 0.1 cent, to $3.29 for a million British thermal units. The contract has soared from about $2.70 over the last two weeks as Enron's troubles became public. 
''Enron has a massive exposure to both the buy side and the sell side in gas and other commodities,'' said Jay Saunders, oil and gas analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, ''and if they're at risk financially, then you're exposed to that so you want to cover that risk. Anybody who has Enron as a counterparty in a trade might be concerned about getting paid.'' 
Mr. Saunders added that other factors had also lifted prices lately, including falling rates of gas being put in storage for use this winter.

The State CalPERS Is Urged to Challenge Enron Finance: The public employee pension fund holds 3 million shares of the energy firm, whose stock has plunged. State senator calls for action.

SACRAMENTO -- A state senator has encouraged the managers of California's public employee retirement fund to challenge, perhaps with a lawsuit, the management of Enron Corp., the high-flying energy company whose stock has plummeted more than 80% in the last year. 
The California Public Employee Retirement System, the nation's biggest public pension fund, owns roughly 3 million shares of Enron common stock. Enron shares, once valued at nearly $85, fell $1.91 Thursday to $11.99 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) urged management of CalPERS to deal aggressively with the Houston-based company, which is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for a potential conflict of interest by its former chief financial officer. 
Investors have begun complaining of a paucity of information released by Enron about its financial transactions, and the stock has fallen dramatically in response. On Thursday, a major credit agency, Standard & Poor's, lowered its ratings on Enron, dealing the company another financial blow. 
""It is clear that the events surrounding Enron have created a serious lack of confidence in the judgment of Enron's management team,"" Peace wrote Tuesday in a letter to CalPERS Chief Executive James E. Burton. ""It is, therefore, incumbent on CalPERS, as trustee of public employees' ownership rights and as founder of the corporate governance movement, to improve Enron's corporate governance to increase share value."" 
In an interview, Peace said CalPERS should consider a shareholder lawsuit or join with other shareholders to force out Enron's management. CalPERS provides retirement and health benefits to more than 1.2 million state and local public employees and their families. 
Enron officials did not respond to a request for comment on Peace's letter. CalPERS officials said they were considering the letter. 
Peace has clashed repeatedly with Enron since the early 1990s, when the company was trying to influence the utility regulators and lawmakers forging a plan to turn California's regulated electricity industry into a competitive market. Peace chaired the legislative committee that crafted deregulation legislation. 
""Enron wants a market where consumers have limited knowledge, and they want to operate their business where stockholders have the most limited information possible,"" Peace said in an interview. 
Once a natural gas pipeline company, Enron has grown into the world's largest energy trader. 
Besides owning Enron stock, CalPERS has joined with the firm to invest in energy development. 
In 1993, CalPERS and Enron each contributed $250 million to an investment fund guided by Enron. When CalPERS ended the partnership in 1997 and sold its position to Enron, it earned $125 million, a 23% return, a CalPERS spokesman said. They teamed up again in 1998, with each putting up $500 million for energy industry investments. Enron tapped $150 million of CalPERS' money before CalPERS' commitment to the partnership expired.

Thanks to interest-free financing, General Motors and Ford Motor reported sharply higher October auto sales while Chrysler saw a more modest rise. GM reported that it sold 546,093 vehicles last month, a 31 percent increase over October 2000. Ford sold 400,893 vehicles in October, 36 percent more than the same month a year ago. Sales of DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brand vehicles were up 5 percent, with just more than 209,000 units sold. GM set an all-time monthly record for truck sales, while sales of Ford's beleaguered Explorer SUV set an October record. 
Enron Gets Loan -- at a Price
Enron received a $1 billion loan from J.P. Morgan Chase and Salomon Smith Barney but had to pledge its natural gas pipelines as collateral. Pledging the pipelines signals Enron's desperation to convince shareholders and trading partners that it's creditworthy as the Securities and Exchange Commission investigates partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, investors said. Questions about Enron's dealings with the partnerships have shut it out of commercial-paper markets, where most large corporations go to find low-interest, short-term debt.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS: Enron's dominant position is fuelling fears for markets: John Labate and Julie Earle consider the implications of the company's woes: 
Financial Times; Nov 2, 2001
By JULIE EARLE and JOHN LABATE

Nothing has added to Enron's growth more than its aggressive and dominant position in the trading markets for gas and electricity that the Houston-based company helped to create. 
A decade-long series of bold and innovative moves by Enron has not only changed the company but transformed the way US energy companies manage risk and trade energy products from region to region. 
On any given day Enron is the principal in about 25 per cent of the online and offline trades in the energy and natural gas markets, according to analysts' estimates. 
With an ongoing investigation by US securities regulators into Enron's accounting and disclosure practices, and Enron's market value falling by half in the past two weeks, many are wondering what impact Enron's mounting troubles could have on the trading markets. 
Analysts say that in the worst case, long-term scenarios, if Enron's debt is downgraded to junk status or if the company depletes its considerable cash resources, the energy and natural gas markets could be hit in multiple ways. 
""If you have something as big as Enron in a space saying they have no more money, you would have real effects and volatility in the market,"" said Todd Shipman, an analyst at credit rating agency Standard & Poor's. 
Few competitors want to see Enron exit the trading markets, however, since it provides so much liquidity to the markets, and fewer expect that to happen. 
Many of Enron's energy rivals, including Dynegy, Aquila and Duke Energy, are also trading partners, or counterparties to Enron. As such they may be closely tied to Enron's fate in the short term. 
The biggest near-term threat is if there is another change in Enron's credit status. 
This week Moody's Investors Service downgraded Enron to two notches above junk status. Further reductions are, for the moment, the main worry among its rivals and trading partners, although Enron debt remains at investment-grade levels. 
""Certainly, whenever anybody is downgraded to junk status, their counterparties become concerned about how much credit they will extend,"" said Gerald Keenan, a partner at PWC Consulting in Chicago. 
""Everyone is re-evaluating their credit exposure to Enron but few companies have stopped trading with it. 
""It is often the counterparty of choice since it makes markets in areas where there is not a lot of liquidity."" 
Enron's trading partners are believed so far not to have changed the terms on their existing contracts with Enron. 
However, if Enron's financial status worsens, the lack of confidence could have its own negative impact on the energy trading markets. 
Existing market hedges between these multiple firms in the markets could begin to unwind, analysts warn, which could add to short-term instability in the energy marketplace. 
It is unlikely, however, that energy prices would be hit since terms would quickly be renegotiated and stability return to the trading markets. 
Any change in ownership in Enron could bring stability to the trading markets, say analysts.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS: Dollars 1bn line of credit secured to pay debt 
Financial Times; Nov 2, 2001
By ROBERT CLOW and SHEILA MCNULTY

Enron, the troubled US energy trading group, has secured a Dollars 1bn credit line with JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup arm, Salomon Smith Barney. 
Enron's management signalled last weekend that it expected to raise more cash to supplement the Dollars 3.3bn it received last week from drawing down its bank lines. 
The new loan will be secured against the assets of Enron's Northern Natural Gas company and Transwestern Pipeline. The proceeds will pay down maturing debt and increase short-term funds. 
Enron declined to comment on the terms and conditions of the deal, saying it was not yet closed. 
On Octoberm, 16 Enron management announced a Dollars 1.01bn charge and a Dollars 1.2bn reduction of shareholders equity as a result of off-balance sheet private equity transactions set up by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer. 
Those deals raised questions about whether Mr Fastow was acting in the best interests of Enron's other shareholders, which became the basis for a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. 
If the credit rating agencies downgrade the company's debt further, counterparties might increase the collateral they require to trade with Enron. That could squeeze the embattled company's profit margins still further. 
It is not yet clear how the rating agencies will react to Enron borrowing against its pipeline assets. Their stable revenues have been one of the cornerstones of Enron's rating. 
In an effort to safeguard its ratings, a senior management delegation told all the rating agencies on Wednesday that it was going to be retreating from risk taking. 
""We are going to explore new markets,"" the company said. ""But what we have learned that we can expand into new markets without making large expenditures."" www.ft.com/energy

WORLD STOCK MARKETS: Wall St buoyed by Microsoft peace talks 
Financial Times; Nov 2, 2001
By MARY CHUNG

US equities overcameearly hesitancy to risedecisively by midday as investors shrugged off grim manufacturing data and focused on Microsoft's tentative agreement to settle its antitrust battle with the government. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 67.59 at 9,142.73 and the S&P 500 index 8.60 at 1,068.38. The Nasdaq Composite rose 23.66 at 1,713.86. 
Investors cheered news that the US Justice Department and Microsoft had agreed the outline of a settlement requiring the world's largest software company to give computer manufacturers more freedom in the design of Windows desktops. 
Microsoft rose 4 per cent at Dollars 60.54 and gave a boost to the technology sector as shares in Oracle added 2 per cent Dollars 13.79, Cisco climbed 1.4 per cent at Dollars 17.15 and Sun Microsystems gained 4 per cent at Dollars 10.55. 
Chip stocks were broadly higher, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index up 4 per cent. Shares in Intel tacked on 2.2 per cent at Dollars 24.97 and Advanced Micro Devices climbed 6.3 per cent at Dollars 10.46. 
The sector was boosted by an industry report showing the third consecutive month of smaller declines for chip sales. Stocks had flirted in negative territory after more disappointing economic data painting a bleak picture for the US economy. 
The National Association of Purchasing Management data showing factory activity fell to a nine-year low in October. 
The data followed a report from the labour department showing the number of Americans requesting unemployment insurance benefits on an ongoing basis rose to the highest since May 1983. 
Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at CIBC World Markets, said he was encouraged by the market's ability to bounce back from negative news. 
""Even when bad news happens, there's initial weakness then the market bounces back,"" he said. 
However, woes continued for Enron, the embattled energy trading company, which fell 9.4 per cent at Dollars 12.59 after the US Securities and Exchange Commission upgraded its probe into the company's accounting methods to a formal investigation. 
United Airlines rose 2 per cent at Dollars 13 in spite of a third-quarter loss of Dollars 1.16bn. 
Eastman Kodak rebounded 2 per cent at Dollars 26.07 after seeing heavy losses this week amid an analyst downgrade and a cut in its debt rating by Moody's Investor Service. 
Toronto was flat in late morning trade and by midsession the TSE-300 composite index was just 8.30 higher at 6,894.00.

Enron gets $1 billion more 
Pledging assets, credit downgrade bruise shares 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Enron Corp.'s bid to shore up investor confidence by announcing it had lined up $1 billion in credit didn't succeed Thursday. 
Shares in Houston's largest company closed down $1.91 at $11.99. And that was before a second rating agency downgraded Enron's credit ratings. 
The action by Standard & Poor's wasn't a surprise to Wall Street and isn't likely to help Enron's sagging shares. 
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said Thursday morning it had reached a deal with the investment banking units of Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. for $1 billion in credit lines to be backed by a significant portion of Enron's pipeline assets. 
Last week, Enron tapped into a $3.3 billion revolving credit line that wasn't secured by collateral. It banked about $1.1 billion and is using the rest to pay off short-term debt obligations. 
Investors reacted Thursday to several pieces of news. 
One was Wednesday night's disclosure by Enron that federal securities regulators are formally investigating business dealings between Enron and investment partnerships formerly run by Andrew Fastow, who Enron removed last week as chief financial officer. 
Since Enron revealed two financial hits related to the investment partnerships on Oct. 16, Wall Street has raised an expanding number of questions about its financial health. Some investors also saw the fact that Enron's new credit will be asset-backed as negative. 
""What it tells you is that now they have to start using the crown jewels as security,"" said Donald Coxe, chairman of Harris Investment Management, where the Harris Insight Equity Fund owns about 78,000 shares in Enron. ""Any royal family which has to pledge the crown and scepter to get a loan in the private markets tends to be about three days from the republicans breaking down the barriers of the palaces."" 
But Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said using the assets as collateral meant Enron could get the credit negotiated quickly. 
""It has to do with speed,"" he said, adding that Enron sought to reassure outsiders its balance sheet is strong and that it has available cash to support its core energy trading business. 
Of the new credit, which is expected to be finalized shortly, $250 million will be used to pay off debt obligation that's about to mature. The rest will be available as cash, Palmer said. 
The assets of its Northern Natural Gas Co. and Transwestern Pipeline Co., the collateral Enron pledged could support another $200 million in credit if need be, he said, adding that Enron didn't believe it needed more than $1 billion. 
Enron, which transformed itself from a pipeline company to a trader in everything from electricity to paper, still has about 25,000 miles of pipelines. The two assets pledged represent more than 19,000 miles of that. 
Monday, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Enron's long-term debt one level to a rating that's still two notches above what are commonly called junk bonds. 
Thursday, Standard & Poor's did the equivalent. It is also downgraded Enron's short-term ratings and said it was reviewing the company for potential additional downgrades. 
If Enron's credit ratings fall from investment grade to junk status, it will trigger a wave negative consequences, including some that would damage its trading business. 
Part of Enron's purpose in setting up new credit is to help it keep an investment-grade rating. 
In its report, S&P said it downgraded Enron because it believes the company's plans, including asset sales, won't be enough to warrant the credit rating Enron had. It expressed concerns that Enron could face some permanent erosion of its share of the energy trading market if its main competitors take advantage of its weakened state and could have trouble keeping key personnel. 
Carol Coale, a stock analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, said in a report Thursday that Enron may need to issue 120 million new shares or more ""to keep the rating agencies at bay."" 


USA: WRAPUP 2-Enron lines up cash to soothe worried Wall Street.
By Jeff Franks

11/02/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., gathering money to soothe a worried Wall Street, lined up $1 billion of new credit on Thursday, then saw its credit rating cut for a second time this week as the nation's largest energy trader struggled to restore investor confidence shaken by questionable financial transactions. 
Shares in the Houston-based company, whose dealings are under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, tumbled $1.91, or 13.7 percent, to $11.99 as the market continued a two-week-long pummeling of the stock.
At issue are off-the-balance sheet deals with limited partnerships, run by then-chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, which contributed to a $1 billion charge against third quarter earnings and a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity announced on Oct. 16. Angry investors say Enron has not fully explained the transactions or whether it faces more liabilities. 
The company, taking the tack that an having abundance of money available would ease fears about its financial stability, said on Thursday it got $1 billion in credit lines from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc. 
The new credit, which comes on top of $3.3 billion in lines that Enron tapped last week, came with the proviso that the company's gas and pipeline assets be put up as collateral, a measure usually reserved for firms with ""junk"" credit ratings. 
ALLAY FEARS 
But a grateful Ken Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, thanked the two Wall Street institutions for their support and said the credit infusion should help allay investors' fears. 
""We very much appreciate the support of two of our long-standing banking partners,"" he said in a statement. ""With more than $1 billion in cash currently on our balance sheet, this additional credit capacity will further solidify Enron's standing as the leading market maker in wholesale energy markets."" 
The good news was tempered later in the day by Standard & Poor's announcement that it had cut Enron's credit rating and could do so again if the situation worsens. 
The rating agency cut Enron's corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to ""BBB,"" two notches above junk status, from ""BBB-plus,"" its subordinated debt rating to ""BBB-minus"" from ""BBB,"" and its commercial paper rating to ""A-3"" from ""A-2."" 
It also downgraded ratings for several Enron share trusts. 
Downgrades could make it harder for Enron to issue debt and run its day-to-day business as fellow marketers and traders demand more collateral. If the ratings fall to junk, or below investment-grade, Enron could be forced to issue more shares, analysts said. 
S&P said it cut the ratings because of questions about whether Enron was taking sufficient action to fully restore its credit quality. 
""The company's financial flexibility has continued to diminish. This crisis of investor confidence can be traced ... directly to the company's inability to calm investors that are unsure about the strength of Enron's core energy marketing business and the viability of the company's plan to restore its credit profile,"" it said. 
FULL DISCLOSURE 
""A full, frank disclosure and discussion of the business and financial issues facing the company and its plans to address them will be necessary before investors will be able to confidently evaluate the merits of investing in Enron securities,"" the agency added. 
S&P nevertheless said Enron's liquidity position is ""adequate"" to see the company through its current problems and that Enron was unlikely to see its position as the industry's top energy marketer endangered as long as it operated transparently. 
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service cut Enron's long-term debt to ""Baa2,"" also two notches above junk, and warned it may cut that rating and Enron's ""Prime-2"" commercial paper rating. 
Enron was once a Wall Street darling lauded for its ability to create new Internet-based commodity markets that produced soaring profits and a stock price that seemed to defy gravity. 
But setbacks in its bandwidth business and overseas investments, plus problems arising from the California power crisis hurt its do-no-wrong image. And in August, former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling shocked the financial world by resigning after just six months on the job, citing personal reasons. 
The stock, whose year-high was $84, began to sink, then fell off a cliff after the company's Oct. 16 announcement. That day, shares closed at $33.84. 
Trying to shore up its credibility, Enron replaced Fastow last week with another Enron executive, Jeff McMahon. 
The company said on Wednesday an SEC ""informal inquiry"" begun Oct. 22 had become a formal investigation, possibly indicating regulators did not like what they had seen. It elected University of Texas law school dean William Powers to the board of directors and put him in charge of an internal probe into the deals. 
Despite all the bad news of recent weeks, Enron said on Thursday its core business of energy trading was going strong. 
Enron spokesman Eric Thode said transactions on the Houston-based company's widely watched Internet EnronOnline system were averaging some $3 billion to $4 billion a day, up from a 30-day average of $2.5 billion. 
Enron is by far the nation's largest natural gas and electricity trader, with industry analysts estimating it is involved in some 25 percent of daily trade in those markets.

ENRON CORP.: Credit rating cut again; $1 billion secured

(Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune)

Troubled Enron Corp. said Thursday it has secured $1 billion in new financing, but then saw its credit rating cut for the second time this week and watched its stock price take another dive. 
Enron said it got $1 billion in credit lines from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., but had to put up its natural gas and pipeline assets as collateral.
Standard & Poor's cut its ratings for Enron, downgrading its corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to BBB, two notches above junk status. Earlier this week, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company's long-term debt. 
Enron shares dropped nearly 14 percent, or $1.91 per share, to close at $11.99 on the New York Stock Exchange. After dropping to a nine-year low Tuesday, shares of the nation's largest natural gas and power marketer rose 25 percent Wednesday amid speculation the company was a takeover candidate. 
But after the markets closed Wednesday, Enron announced the Securities and Exchange Commission had opened an investigation into possible conflicts of interest. The SEC is apparently looking into dealings Enron had with partnerships led by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who was forced out last week. 
Late Wednesday, Enron said it created a special committee headed by University of Texas law school dean William Powers to respond to the SEC investigation. Powers also was elected to Enron's board of directors.

India ONGC Plans Enron Oil,Gas Field Bid If BG Deal Fails

11/02/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

SINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- India's state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) said Friday that it would consider bidding for Enron Corp.'s (ENE) upstream Indian assets if U.K.-based BG Group PLC's (BRG) conditional acquisition of the assets collapses. 
BG paid $388 million for Enron's 30% stake in oil and gas fields offshore western India, but the sale is subject to a number of consents and conditions including confirmation from Enron and Gas India's joint venture partners - ONGC and Reliance Industries Ltd. (P.REL) - that BG will inherit field operator status from Enron.
ONGC and Reliance Industries are challenging BG's goal of acquiring Enron's operatorship of the offshore Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukti oil and gas field. BG have made it clear it would walk away from the deal if it didn't get outright operatorship. 
""If BG wants to walk away, we'll come up with a plan. If they (Enron) offer (an opportunity to bid again), yes, then we will think about it,"" an ONGC spokesman told Dow Jones Newswires, without elaborating further. 
Earlier this year, ONGC bid a reported $400 million for Enron's Indian oil and gas assets, only to have its bid rejected. Analysts at the time said Enron was unlikely to settle for anything less than $600 million for its stake in the venture. 
ONGC and Reliance Industries jointly hold a 70% stake in the assets. 
As reported Thursday, BG said it will extend the negotiation period on the operatorship of the fields for an unspecified period. 
However, analysts say BG's bid for operator status will continue to face stiff resistance from ONGC and Reliance. 
""We want the operatorship,"" the ONGC spokesman reiterated. 
Enron's upstream oil and gas assets in India hold proven and probable reserves of around 170 million barrels of oil equivalent.

Enron May Sell India Dabhol Power Shr At Discount-Lender
By Himendra Kumar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/02/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) may sell its equity in India's 2,184 megawatt Dabhol Power Co. plant at a discount given its financial woes back home, a senior official of the Industrial Development Bank of India (P.IDB) told Dow Jones Newswires. 
""There's a possibility of Enron selling its equity in Dabhol real cheap because that company desperately needs cash. Anything below $500 million will be a good price to pay for their Dabhol stake,"" said the IDBI official.
India's banks and financial institutions have a total exposure of about $1.4 billion in the Dabhol power plant, located in the western India state of Maharashtra. IDBI's own exposure in Dabhol is in excess of 20 billion rupees ($1=INR48.00). 
Enron has a controlling 65% equity stake in Dabhol and wants to sell it because of payment defaults by the plant's sole customer - the Maharashtra State Electricity Board - and the Indian federal government's failure to honor payment guarantees. Back in August the U.S. company said it was willing to sell its equity at cost. 
Enron India spokesman Jimmy Mogal confirmed that Dabhol Power Co. was currently in talks with the government and Indian financial institutions but declined to say what price Enron was seeking. 
""DPC continues to hold discussions with the government of India and Indian financial institutions regarding the sale of foreign sponsor equity in the Dabhol project. It would not be appropriate to elaborate further on the recurring media speculation with respect to the status of these buyout discussions,"" Mogal said in a faxed reply to questions. 
""While we remain hopeful for an amicable resolution of this issue, DPC continues to pursue the available legal remedies under the contract documents in order to protect the interests of DPC's stake holder,"" he added. 
R.K. Pachauri, director of the independent think tank Tata Energy Research Institute, said the time was right for a company to negotiate a bargain from cash-strapped Enron for its Dabhol equity. 
""Even $700 million would be a good price. All said and done, Dabhol is a world class project. People now need to get their act together and settle for a deal since the time is fast running out,"" Pachauri said. 
The Houston-based Enron is attempting to persuade banks to provide additional credit to bolster its financial position after a precipitous fall in its share price. Last week, the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion in credit after it encountered difficulties in raising funds in the commercial paper market. 
The IDBI official said Enron's Indian lenders don't see any logic in buying out its equity in Dabhol because they don't want a non-performing asset. 
But he said one possible option being talked about was the state-owned company National Thermal Power Corp. (P.NTP) buying Enron's stake. 
""The government has to decide fast who will buy this equity. A state-owned company like the National Thermal Power Corp., which has core competence in the power sector, may be asked to buy Enron's stake. Later, NTPC can always resell it at a higher price,"" the official said. 
Local newspapers say India's privately-owned BSES Ltd. (P.BSX) and Tata Power Co. Ltd. (P.TPW) may also be interested in buying out Enron's Dabhol stake. 
No Tata Power official was immediately available for comment and a BSES official declined to comment when reached by Dow Jones Newswires. 
The IDBI official said he hoped the government will take a decision before Nov. 9 when the Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee visits the U.S. to attend the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York. 
He said Enron may send a final contract termination notice to MSEB any time after Nov. 19 and then the dispute will have to be settled by the Court of Arbitration in London. 
""Should India lose the case, it may have to pay Enron damages ranging anywhere between $4 billion-$5 billion. Enron has a history of not losing any litigation,"" he warned. 
Local media reports over the past two months have said Enron wants $1.00 billion for its stake in Dabhol. 
A senior India power ministry official said the government favored an early solution to the Dabhol crisis but added that no decision had been taken yet on who would buy Enron's equity. 
""We are committed toward resolving the Dabhol dispute amicably. Talks are on and nothing definite has been decided yet. But I am hopeful, the dispute will end on a happy note, sometime very soon,"" said the government official. 
Dabhol is India's largest single foreign investment. MSEB has 15%, while General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel (X.BTL) own 10% each.

`Buying out Enron's stake in Dabhol unit won't help'

11/02/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MUMBAI: Buying out Enron's stake in the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) is no resolution since the tariff will still be unviable, analysts say. 
Even as Enron Corp is preparing to sell off its stake in the project to Indian financial institutions, who have lent huge sums to the project, experts say a buy-out would make sense only if the bid for Enron's share of $ 1.3 billion is discounted to under $ 500 million and the loan component is written off by at least $ 500 million, says convenor of the Enron Virodhi Andolan, Pradyumna Kaul.
``The project will continue to be unviable even after buying it at low cost,'' Mr Kaul asserts. ``If LNG is the fuel, the energy price will still be more than Rs 2 per unit, given the fact that oil will be more than 25 per barrel. This will ensure that the unit cost of power will never be less than Rs 3.20,'' he says. 
At the moment, Enron is willing to sell power at Rs 3.60 per unit at 90 per cent offtake, he points out. But this is not possible because a high offtake will not be permitted by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission in the absence of demand. The MERC has told the state eletricity board to buy costliest power the last. ``And at a low offtake, the plant will be grossly unviable,'' an expert says. 
Apart from buying Enron's stake at a low cost, it is necessary to reduce interest rates from Indian FIs, slash customs duty and sales tax on fuel, he says. These are some of the demands that DPC has already placed before the govermment. ``Even if the plant is sold, these factors will hike up the cost,'' he said. 
Another alternative is to use the plant for peaking load alone, to be used only during a few hours of the day. This would bring down costs, anti-Enron activist Abhay Mehta said. In practical terms, he said, the only player to benefit from a sale is Enron Corp which is desperately looking to sell its stake. 
Such a prospect leaves some grey areas about the future of the judicial inquiry ordered recently by the Democratic Front government. The probe is yet to get under way and the supreme court case against the project is pending hearing. 
While officials admit that legally the actions will continue, it will not be as effective as if the company is still in the field. It is also possible to come to a mutually acceptable settlement before Enron exits the country or speed up the actions, they say. 
``These repercussions are secondary; the moot point is a speedy solution to the Enron issue,'' says an official. 
Mr Mehta says the fact that chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has already agreed to an extension for the judicial probe beyond six months, ``if it is found necessary'' suggests that the government ``is not really serious about solving the issue but will rather keep dragging the case till the chickens come home to roost and some political points are scored.'' 
``The state government's attitude is like that of an ostrich: if you ignore a problem long enough, it will go away,'' he says.

Dabhol lenders' meet in London cancelled

The meeting of the lenders of the Enron-promoted Dabhol power project scheduled for November 2 and 3 in London has been cancelled. 
This was supposed to be the last meeting of the lenders before the November 19 deadline by which the Dabhol Power Company is required to fire its final termination notice.
Sources in the domestic as well as the global lenders consortium confirmed the cancellation of the meeting, but gave conflicting reasons for this. Some domestic lenders maintained that the meeting was postponed because a solution to the Dabhol problem was in sight. ""The government is working out a solution to the problem along with the domestic financial institutions,"" they said. 
""It only makes sense to meet after the solution is worked out,"" said a source in the domestic lenders consortium. 
This was sharply contested by a source in the foreign lenders consortium who said that the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) chairman & managing director P P Vohra and ICICI chief executive officer K V Kamath were to attend the meeting, but their last minute engagements resulted in the cancellation of the meeting.

USA: Critics question Andersen's handling of Enron.
By Kevin Drawbaugh

11/01/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Andersen, a top accounting firm, should have done more as auditor for energy giant Enron Corp. to alert investors to certain partnerships tied to the company that are now being investigated by U.S. authorities, accounting experts said on Thursday. 
As the Houston-based energy trading group dealt with a deepening crisis, critics of its auditor Andersen said the accountants should have pushed harder for more and clearer disclosure of the partnerships' potential for conflicts of interest and financial risk to Enron.
""Not only is the disclosure seemingly inadequate as to where it's put, it's inadequate as to the attention that's paid to it. Then thirdly, it's almost unintelligible,"" said Mark Cheffers, who heads Massachusetts-based accounting consultancy AccountingMalpractice.com, in an interview. 
Enron, whose share price slumped again on Thursday, said on Wednesday that it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the top U.S. financial markets regulator. An SEC spokesman declined to comment. 
Enron last month ousted its chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who was instrumental in setting up and managing certain outside partnerships that have been linked to the SEC probe. 
Enron's ties to the partnerships were disclosed in Enron reports to the SEC and investors. Andersen, based in Chicago, audited those reports and approved them as fair and complete. 
Asked about criticisms of the job the firm did, Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton said: ""We are committed to quality auditing and protecting the investor interest. Knowledgeable parties are looking at these matters. We're not going to respond to speculative commentary."" 
Enron disclosed in its March 2001 proxy statement that in the year 2000 it paid Andersen $25 million in auditor fees, as well as $27 million in fees for various other work. 
Enron - a former natural gas pipeline group that transformed itself into the nation's largest energy trader - saw its stock close down on Thursday near an eight-year low, having lost two-thirds of its value since mid-October. 
Investors began dumping Enron shares after reports of off-the-balance sheet transactions involving two limited partnerships run by Fastow, who was replaced last week by another Enron executive, Jeff McMahon. 
FASTOW'S DUAL ROLE SEEN AT HEART OF CONTROVERSY 
How Fastow could have balanced his duties as Enron CFO with his role as head of the partnerships - which regularly did business with Enron - is the key question, sources said. 
The partnerships - called LJM2 Co-Investment LP and LJM Cayman LP - were set up expressly to do huge volumes of highly complex financial transactions wi???stow's employer. The transactions were disclosed to Enron investors in annual 10K filings and pr???2000 and 2001. 
But Andersen should have done more to put the disclosures in plain English and highlight their potential for possible conflicts and risk to Enron's finances, said critics. 
Enron last month said it was taking a $1 billion charge against earnings, as well as cutting shareholder equity by $1.2 billion due to transactions with the Fastow-led entities. 
""A firm of Andersen's magnitude and reputation should always be aware of such possibilities. They should be able to presuppose the what-ifs in any condition,"" said Jay Nisberg, an accounting consultant based in Ridgefield, Connecticut. 
An Enron spokeswoman said Andersen knew about the LJM partnerships. ""We made them aware of our transactions with the partnerships and they reviewed them to the extent they deemed necessary,"" said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. 
Even investors in the partnerships, which by most accounts were tremendously profitable, questioned how they were set up, with Enron employee Fastow at their head. 
One early investor in LJM2 was the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, a pension fund with $8 billion in assets. zz zz.

Enron: Online Trading Volume Sees Normal Decline Thursday

11/01/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) electronic trading system, EnronOnline.com, saw a little more than 6,600 transactions Thursday, down from Wednesday's 7,100 transactions, Enron spokesman Eric Thode said. 
The decline is typical of a reduction in energy trading activity at the beginning of the month, said Thode, who added that EnronOnline volume Oct. 1 was 5,200 deals. As in the past two weeks, the volume of transactions Thursday exceeded the 30-day average volume of about 5,600 daily transactions.
""All companies were transacting that we would expect to be transacting,"" Thode said. 
On Thursday, energy traders said EnronOnline, on which Enron is the counterparty for all deals, was less active. At one key western electricity hub, Palo Verde, Ariz., EnronOnline's bid to buy power for delivery in December was $34.35 a megawatt-hour, compared with the best bid of $34.50 a megawatt-hour on the IntercontinentalExchange, a competing Internet-based trading system. EOL's offer to sell the same contract was 35 cents higher. EOL's bid-offer spreads were also wider for Northeast power and western gas at midday Thursday, though they were competitive for Northeast gas. 
Generally, EOL presents tighter spreads in its key markets than the spreads found either on competing electronic systems or in the phone-broker market. Those aggressive bids have helped propel volumes on EOL since its inception in November 1999. 
""Spreads fluctuate based on the markets. Every company has different perceptions,"" Thode said when asked about the narrower spreads on EOL. 
""The power market for the past two weeks has been fairly quiet. There's been little volatility. Gas markets fairly volatile, and the increased volumes have come from primarily natural gas markets,"" Thode said.

Power supplier Enron's stock drops another 14 percent
By MARK BABINECK
Associated Press Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Troubled Enron Corp. said Thursday it has secured $1 billion in new financing, using its natural gas and pipeline assets as collateral. But its stock price took another dive after rising a day earlier on takeover speculation. 
In trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares fell nearly 14 percent, or $1.91 a share, to $11.99.
After dropping to a nine-year low on Tuesday, shares of the nation's largest natural gas and power marketer rose 25 percent Wednesday amid speculation the Houston-based company was a takeover candidate. 
But after the stock market closed for the day, Enron, an important supplier to power-starved California, announced the Securities and Exchange Commission had opened a formal investigation into possible conflicts of interest. 
The SEC is apparently looking into dealings Enron had with partnerships led by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who was forced out last month as investors fled because of questions about the arrangements. 
While referring to the latest SEC news as ""noise,"" Merrill Lynch analyst Donato J. Eassey said it would subdue Enron's stock price. 
""We believe the timing and directional uncertainty of this new development will at best cap Enron's stock price in the mid-teens while increasing overall volatility,"" Eassey said in a note Thursday. 
Late Wednesday, Enron said it created a special committee headed by University of Texas law school dean William Powers to respond to the SEC investigation. Powers also was elected to Enron's board of directors. 
""I have asked the board to take this action to address fully and forthrightly investors' questions and concerns,"" said Enron chairman and chief executive Kenneth L. Lay. ""We will also make every appropriate public disclosure during the course of the SEC's investigation."" 
However, Duane Grubert, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein and Co. in New York, said Enron still has much to do to restore investor confidence. 
""With (stock) values this low, you've got two camps of investors: guys that hate Enron and guys that want to be cautiously attracted to Enron,"" Grubert said. ""It's led to the trading range being irrationally low and shares being oversold. It's not something the company wants."" 
Enron's stock has skidded since the company reported a $638 million third quarter loss just over two weeks ago, dragged down by a one-time charge of $1.01 billion attributed to various losses. Some of these losses have been tied to partnerships managed by Fastow, who was ousted last week. 
Earlier this week, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company's long-term debt and warned of possible further downgrades. 
On Tuesday, shares hit a nine-year low of $11.16. With such a depressed stock price, the Wall Street Journal reported that Enron was being eyed as a possible takeover target. 
Potential buyers include General Electric's GE Capital unit, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Royal Dutch Shell, the Journal said.

USA: UPDATE 1-S&P cuts Enron ratings, may cut ratings again.

11/01/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's on Thursday cut its ratings for embattled energy trader Enron Corp. and warned it may cut the ratings again because of what it described as ""uncertainties"" surrounding the company and the possibility it may face further problems in the capital markets. 
Houston-based Enron said on Wednesday it is being probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Downgrades could make it tougher for Enron to issue debt and run its day-to-day business as fellow marketers and traders demand more collateral. If the ratings fall to junk, or below investment-grade, Enron could be forced to issue more shares. 
S&P cut Enron's corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to ""BBB,"" two notches above junk status, from ""BBB-plus,"" its subordinated debt rating to ""BBB-minus"" from ""BBB,"" and its commercial paper rating to ""A-3"" from ""A-2."" 
The rating agency also downgraded ratings for several Enron share trusts. 
S&P warned it may cut all of these ratings again. A downgrade to the commercial paper rating would take that rating to junk status. All leading U.S. rating agencies, including S&P, generally rate all of a company's senior unsecured debt and commercial paper either investment-grade or junk. 
S&P nevertheless said Enron's liquidity position is ""adequate"" to see the company through its current problems. 
So long as Enron provides market participants with their usual liquidity and price transparency, it said, ""it is unlikely that any significant long-term damage to Enron's franchise as the premier energy marketer will be sustained."" 
The S&P analyst who covers Enron was not immediately available for further comment. 
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service cut Enron's long-term debt to ""Baa2,"" also two notches above junk, and warned it may cut that rating and Enron's ""Prime-2"" commercial paper rating. 
Enron shares closed Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange at $11.99, down $1.91, or 13.7 percent. They have fallen 65 percent since Oct. 16, when Enron said it would take $1.01 billion in charges for certain investments. The shares hit a nine-year low on Tuesday. 
""CRISIS OF INVESTOR CONFIDENCE"" 
S&P said Enron's plan to sell assets and use other means to repair its ""damaged balance sheet"" will be ""insufficient"" to restore its historical ""BBB-plus"" ratings. 
""This crisis of investor confidence can be traced ... directly to the company's inability to calm investors that are unsure about the strength of Enron's core energy marketing business and the viability of the company's plan to restore its credit profile,"" it said. 
""A full, frank disclosure and discussion of the business and financial issues facing the company and its plans to address them will be necessary before investors will be able to confidently evaluate the merits of investing in Enron securities,"" S&P added. 
Enron said on Thursday it obtained $1 billion in secured credit lines in a bid to help support day-to-day trading operations and bolster investor confidence. 
""We are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating,"" said Jeffrey McMahon, who last week became Enron's new chief financial officer, in a statement issued on Thursday.

Enron's Credit Rating Cut After $1 Bln Loan Secured (Update9)
2001-11-01 18:27 (New York)

Enron's Credit Rating Cut After $1 Bln Loan Secured (Update9)

     (Adds company comment in 17th to 19th paragraphs.)

     Houston, Nov. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, received a $1 billion loan from J.P. Morgan Chase &
Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. after agreeing to use the
company's natural-gas pipelines as collateral.

     Enron shares fell 14 percent a day after the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission began formally investigating partnerships
run by its former chief financial officer. Pledging the pipelines
signals Enron's desperation to convince shareholders and trading
partners that it's creditworthy, investors said.

     ``It's not reassuring, it's worrisome,'' said Donald Coxe,
manager of the Harris Insight Equity Fund, which owns about 78,000
Enron shares. ``If they had to secure the loan, obviously the
lenders don't think they can rely on Enron's financial
statements.''

     Standard & Poor's said after U.S. markets closed that it cut
Enron's long-term credit rating to ``BBB,'' the second-lowest
investment grade, from ``BBB+.'' Its short-term debt rating was
cut to ``A-3,'' one grade above junk status, from ``A-2.'

     The SEC is investigating partnerships run by former CFO
Andrew Fastow that bought and sold Enron shares and assets. Those
trades cost Enron $35 million and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder
equity. Questions about Enron's dealings with the partnerships
have shut it out of commercial-paper markets, where most large
corporations go to find low-interest, short-term debt.

     Last Friday, Enron tapped a $3 billion credit line to pay off
$2.2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding. Proceeds from
the $1 billion secured loan will go for debt payments and to
supplement cash reserves, Enron said.

                        Business With Enron

     To get the $1 billion loan, Enron pledged assets of its
Northern Natural Gas Co. and Transwestern Pipeline Co., which own
gas pipeline systems that combined are about 19,000 miles long and
can deliver as much as 6 billion cubic feet of gas a day.

     Enron, based in Houston, got its start as a natural gas-
pipeline operator. Over the past decade, the company has shed
assets such as pipelines and power plants and focused on trading
electricity, gas, wood pulp and other commodities.

     Enron now accounts for about a quarter of U.S. power and gas
trades. The company still has about 25,000 miles of gas pipeline.

     Mortgaging those lines is ``maybe not such a good signal,''
said Roger Hamilton, who manages John Hancock Value funds, which
owns 600,000 Enron shares. ``It shows they can't convince banks
with anything but secured assets.''

     Shares of Enron fell $1.91 to $11.99. Earlier, they dropped
to $11.70. The stock has fallen 86 percent this year.

     Enron's 6.4 percent coupon notes due in 2006 fell about 3
cents today to be bid at 74 cents on the dollar and offered at 77
cents, traders said. Until last week, the notes were trading near
par value.

                           Credit Rating

     Enron must have investment-grade credit to borrow enough to
settle its transactions daily. Energy companies including Exelon
Corp. and Northeast Utilities have restricted business with Enron
as the company sought new sources of credit.

     On Monday, Moody's Investors Service lowered Enron's long-
term credit rating to ``Baa2'' from ``Baa1,'' two notches above
junk status. It also placed the company's ``P-2'' rating for
commercial paper on review for possible downgrade.

     Standard & Poor's said in downgrading Enron's credit rating
today that the company has enough liquidity to see it through the
``current period of uncertainty.'' Still, S&P said, Enron's
``financial flexibility has continued to diminish'' because of its
``inability to calm investors that are unsure about the strength
of Enron's core energy marketing business.''

                         Repayment Trigger

     Falling below investment grade would trigger early repayment
terms for $3.3 billion in bonds held by affiliated companies such
as the ones created by Fastow. A lower credit rating also reduces
the amount of cash that Enron can raise to back its trading
business.

     ``There are still two levels before those triggers go into
effect,'' Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said. The announcement of
today's $1 billion loan is ``the latest step in an orderly plan to
strengthen our balance sheet,'' she said. Denne outlined three
steps, which include the credit line and a draw-down of $3 billion
in unsecured credit, which was announced last week.

     The final step is $2.1 billion in asset sales, which the
company outlined on a conference call last week. Enron said it
expects to close on $600 million in sales before year's end.

     The sales include Enron's Azurix North America water business
to American Water Works Inc. for $149.8 million, Enron's Puerto
Rican power-plant company EcoElectrica Holdings Ltd. to Mirant
Corp. and Enron's stake in Brazilian natural-gas distributor Cia.
Distribuidora de Gas do Rio de Janeiro to state-owned Brazilian
oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras. The latter two
transactions are valued at $250 million each, Enron spokesman Mark
Palmer said.

     S&P said today it doesn't think the asset sales and Enron's
other plans will be enough to restore Enron's credit quality to
the ``BBB+'' level it had since 1995.

                        Investor Confidence

     The financing is to ``enhance market and investor
confidence,'' Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said
in a statement.

     Enron can borrow another $200 million by bringing other banks
into the loan, Denne said. ``We don't have any plans to do so at
this point,'' she said.

     ``We are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet
and maintain our investment grade credit rating,'' McMahon said.

     McMahon, then head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO last week. Fastow was ousted in an attempt to restore
investor confidence.

     ``It seems until we know more about the SEC investigation,
it's going to be a difficult time for the stock,'' said Tara
Gately, an energy analyst at Loomis Sayles & Co., which sold most
of its Enron shares early last year.

     J.P. Morgan is advising Enron on the sale of part of Azurix.
Salomon Smith Barney is the investment-banking arm of Citigroup
Inc.

USA: Enron U.S. energy trade so far skirts credit woes.
By Joseph Silha

11/01/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., whose shares slumped again on Thursday amid investors' concerns over a credit crunch, has yet to see that fear seriously dent its dealings with other giants of the U.S. gas and power markets. 
""Trading volumes in our core wholesale businesses remain extremely strong. Every day this week, volume on EnronOnline has exceeded our rolling 30-day average. We are not seeing people hesitate to do business with us,"" Enron spokesman Eric Thode said.
Enron is by far the nation's largest natural gas and electricity trader, with industry analysts estimating it is involved in some 25 percent of daily trade in those markets. 
The company recently became the target of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships headed by Enron's former chief financial officer. 
Thode said transactions on the Houston-based company's widely watched Internet EnronOnline system were averaging some $3 billion to $4 billion a day, up from a 30-day average of $2.5 billion. 
BUSINESS AS USUAL? 
While Enron's dominance of the industry has long been a sore spot with competitors, many of its biggest trading partners said it was business as usual, despite an 80 percent plunge in the company's share price since January. 
But the drain on the company's capital has not gone unnoticed, prompting increased caution among traders but few fears the company will exit the North American energy market. 
""Enron has come under closer scrutiny, but we haven't changed our policy about dealing with the company. This is a one time event. It's a hurricane, but it doesn't mean the weather next year will be bad. Enron will handle this problem,"" Al Butkus, vice president at UtiliCorp United, said. 
Butkus noted Enron's problems stem from how the company financed the purchase of some assets, not from its trading operations. 
Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy, another large trading partner, also has not curbed its business with Enron. 
""We have a credit process for our counterparties which tells us how much collateral is required. That could come into play if there were further problems with Enron's credit, but we haven't seen that yet,"" Duke Energy spokesman Terry Francisco said. 
Traders at Reliant Energy, Williams Cos., Dynegy and El Paso Corp all said they continue to deal with Enron but were closely monitoring the situation. 
CREDIT SQUEEZE 
Despite the current calm among energy traders, analysts cautioned Enron's shrinking capitalization could still squeeze its cash supply and hamper its ability to do business. 
Questions about some off-balance sheet deals with two partnerships helped pummel the company's stock this week to its lowest level since 1992, shrinking market capitalization to less than $9 billion from more than $60 billion in January. 
Most of Enron's power and gas deals are in the unregulated over-the-counter (OTC) market, so no one outside of the company knows what trades are on their books. 
But Enron, the biggest market maker in energy products, has consistently preached a balanced or hedged book. 
""Some people may be scaling back their dealings with Enron, but I think you can rely on Enron to do what they should do in risk management practices,"" Ed Krapels, director at Massachusetts-based Energy Security Analysis Inc told Reuters. 
""I think at the end of the day, their book was balanced enough and they should be able to weather the storm."" 
But Krapels cautioned that further deterioration in Enron's share price and credit standing might force the company to post larger cash deposits with its counterparties and ultimately restrict trading operations. 
Earlier today, Merrill Lynch lowered its rating on Enron's stock to ""neutral"" from ""accumulate"". 
Enron's shares ended down $1.91, or 13.7 percent, at $11.99.

INDIA PRESS:Dabhol Creditors Meeting In London Called Off

11/01/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- A meeting among creditors of India's Dabhol Power Co. in London, originally scheduled for Friday and Saturday, has been cancelled, reports the Business Standard. 
According to some domestic lenders, the meeting was canceled because a solution to the Dabhol's problems was in sight, the newspaper reports.
""The government is working out a solution to the problem along with the domestic financial institutions. It only makes sense to meet after the solution is worked out,"" the report quoted a source in the domestic lenders' consortium as saying. 
However, a source in the foreign lenders' consortium said last-minute engagements of leading executives in Industrial Development Bank Of India and ICICI resulted in the cancellation of the meeting. 
Dabhol, a $2.9 billion, 2,184-megawatt power project located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, is a unit of U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE). 
The project ran into trouble after Dabhol's sole buyer, Maharashtra State Electricity Board, refused to purchase power from the plant, saying the company's tariffs were ""exorbitant and unaffordable."" Enron has threatened to sell its controlling 65% stake in Dabhol following a long-standing payment dispute with MSEB and India's federal government for its failure to honor a payment guarantee. 
Dabhol is India's largest foreign investment to date. Newspaper Web site: www.business-standard.com

finance & economics
houston, we have a problem

11/03/2001
the economist
copyright (c) 2001 the economist; source: world reporter (tm) - ft mccarthy

the troubles of enron, a texan powerhouse in the energy markets, could result in a new financial crisis 
just last year, visitors to enron's glittering headquarters in houston were greeted by a giant banner that proclaimed the firm, ""the world's leading energy company"". that annoyed enron's smaller energy-trading rivals, many of which have offices only a stone's throw away in houston's energy alley, but not as much as what came next - a new banner, declaring enron ""the world's leading company"". in recent weeks, as the company has been engulfed by a financial crisis, that banner has quietly been removed.
the heady mix of audacity, ambition and arrogance revealed by the banners is as good a guide as any to enron's remarkable rise and fall. forged in the 1980s by the merger of two troubled gas-pipeline firms, enron drove the development of the sophisticated spot-and-derivatives markets in energy that it has come to dominate. indeed, such is the scale of its operations, and its dealings with many of the world's financial institutions, that some observers see parallels with long-term capital management (ltcm), the hedge fund that failed in 1998 - and not just because seemingly brilliant financial alchemists have been humbled. were enron to go bust - unlikely, but in the current nervous climate, not impossible - might a crisis ensue? 
troubles in california's politically crazed power market, an ill-advised foray into telecoms bandwidth trading and concerns about management badly dented enron's share price earlier this year, prompting the departure of jeffrey skilling, the firm's newish chief executive, in august. kenneth lay, an avid free-marketeer, friend of george bush and visionary chairman of the firm, was obliged to resume hands-on control. 
this has not slowed enron's decline. day by day, it seems to be sinking deeper into a financial quagmire that is largely of its own creation. not least thanks to its lack of transparency, the firm's credibility with the markets has eroded to the point that talk of a possible takeover or even bankruptcy is widespread. 
enron's reputation for financial wizardry has been turned from an asset to a liability since its third-quarter results came out in mid-october, showing a $1 billion write-off on water distribution, broadband trading and other investments. worse, disclosed only in passing by mr lay in a conference call with analysts, the firm suffered a $1.2 billion reduction in capital, stemming from a hedging deal with a related private-equity fund called ljm. the charge was due to enron's forced sale of 55m of its own shares when the partnership was unwound this summer. almost nobody outside enron had been aware of the terms of the deal with ljm, a ""structured finance vehicle"". 
enron's failure to offer details about the risks from other related partnerships have led many to fear the worst about its huge balance sheet. its shares plunged by 19% on october 30th alone (see chart on next page), before recovering a bit the next day. 
andrew fastow, who was replaced as chief financial officer on october 24th, was a general partner in ljm. jeffrey mcmahon, his successor, has much to do to restore confidence. questions abound. were the trusts run at arm's length? what did mr fastow earn from the partnership? ominously, the securities and exchange commission (sec) has now launched a formal inquiry. 
moody's, a rating agency, last week cut its rating on the company's debt to barely above ""junk"" level. further downgrades might unleash claims from other off-balance-sheet partnerships. those known about, such as atlantic water and marlin water, do not seem big enough to bankrupt enron, but speculation is rife about what other obligations might lurk secretly in other structured vehicles. 
a lower credit rating could destroy enron's core franchise as the leading energy middleman, by scaring away customers and freezing the wholesale energy markets. that might have nasty consequences in other markets. enron acknowledges that it is a large participant in the derivatives market, holding a portfolio with a notional value of $21 billion. rightly or wrongly, many traders believe that figure vastly understates enron's presence. if the firms on the other side of enron's trades start to fear that payment is not coming, they might curb their other trading, producing a knock-on effect. where this could end up is a subject of much conjecture. 
utilities that trade energy could be hit. so could the commodity and derivative operations of large commercial and investment banks. the ties are notably tight between enron and j.p. morgan chase, according to ventana capital, a research firm. not only does j.p. morgan provide innumerable separate credit arrangements for enron; it also has the largest derivative operation of any bank, as well as a large business trading commodities. there is ""no doubt"" that enron is on the other side of many j.p. morgan trades, says ventana. 
were enron to fail, ventana thinks ""it has the potential to cause a major financial crisis"", worse, in some ways, than what occurred after ltcm. that merely froze the debt markets temporarily, whereas enron deals in the building-blocks of the american economy. imagine gridlock in the markets for gas, timber, coal, metals, fertiliser, bandwidth or indeed any of the products enron deals in. 
as yet, this all seems unlikely. many big traders were happy to deal with enron this week, although at shorter maturities and with less complex structures than in the past. trading on enrononline was reportedly strong. jim donnell of duke energy, a big energy trader, described ""a huge dichotomy"" between the collapse in confidence in enron in the equity and credit markets and the ""business as usual"" attitude taken by big commodity trading firms when considering enron as a counterparty. 
yet as questions about enron's credit-standing spread this week, it began to have difficulty making markets in some instruments. few firms would accept enron's name as guarantor of a credit derivative. in its core energy markets some big trading counterparties refused the enron name. on the intercontinental exchange (ice), two houses reportedly specified that they would not take enron's credit. 
the biggest credit exposure appeared to be with banks, whose $3 billion of back-up lines to enron were drawn down last week. j.p. morgan arranged an additional $1 billion emergency credit-line this week. this back-up, it is widely assumed, is needed mainly to meet margin calls triggered by the ratings downgrade. 
too big to fail? 
is enron too big and too important to be allowed to fail? philip verleger, an energy economist, thinks that enron is so central to energy markets that it could not easily be replaced. enron's rivals mostly disagree, unsurprisingly. 
but even enron's worst enemies do not (yet) expect the firm to die from its current crisis. most traders seem keen that it should live. ""nobody likes to see a wholesale trader disappear,"" says one. they admire enron's armies of traders and their ability to do deals. enrononline is one of the internet's few success stories, assuming its huge trading volumes do indeed generate big profits, as the firm claims. 
enron's, and the financial system's, problems could worsen if doubts grow about its ability to meet its obligations. on the surface it is rich in assets, if not cash. but its lack of transparency leaves uncomfortable room for doubt. in june 2000, the economist challenged mr lay to reply to accusations of arrogance, high-handedness and a propensity to push the limits of the law. his response was revealing. to show that such charges were baseless, he pointed to another firm unfairly maligned by critics: drexel burnham lambert, an investment bank that rose from obscurity to market prominence in the junk-bond boom of the 1980s. drexel was accused of arrogance, he groused, but it was only being ""very innovative and very aggressive"". drexel was not bailed out: michael milken, its star, ended up in jail, and drexel collapsed in a heap of bad debts and ignominy.

enron gets $1 billion new credit line, but must pledge top gas-pipeline assets
by rebecca smith
staff reporter of the wall street journal

enron corp. secured $1 billion in new credit lines, but had to pledge its best gas-pipeline assets as collateral. the deal did little to appease an important credit-rating agency. 
standard & poor's ratings group lowered its rating on enron's long-term debt by one notch to triple-b from triple-b-plus and short-term debt to single-a-3 from single-a-2, citing a belief that enron's planned sale of assets ""will be insufficient to restore its long-term credit quality"" to historic levels. moody's investors service inc. had issued debt downgrades earlier this week.
s&p also lowered ratings on the debt of enron's pipeline systems, transwestern pipeline co. and northern natural gas co., that were used to collateralize a $1 billion bank borrowing from j.p. morgan chase & co. and citigroup inc.'s salomon smith barney unit. enron said it would use the money from the 364-day credit lines to refinance roughly $250 million in maturing obligations, leaving it $750 million to boost short-term liquidity. 
in dropping the pipeline credit ratings by two notches, s&p noted that the assets have become ""more strategic to the company,"" in part because they can be relied upon to consistently make money, unlike many other enron hard-asset investments. 
the pipelines produced $450 million in gas-transport revenue and an $85 million pretax profit in the third quarter on generally rising rates. that compared with revenue of $424 million for enron's foreign assets that scraped by with a $19 million earnings contribution. 
todd shipman, credit analyst for s&p, said there have been concerns that enron might take on too much debt, trying to prove it has enough cash on hand to meet its energy-trading obligations. but he said s&p wasn't worried by the most recent borrowing, because ""we don't think it will be a permanent part of the balance sheet."" however, he added that the amount of additional debt it can take on top of the $13 billion it now has outstanding is ""little to none."" with the sharp fall in its stock price, enron's market capitalization is now around $10 billion. 
an enron spokesman said ""it should be a nonissue"" because the company has no intention of borrowing more money anytime soon. 
in announcing the borrowing plan, enron's new chief financial officer, jeff mcmahon, said it was a move to ""enhance investor confidence."" but stock-market investors reacted otherwise and enron stock gave up most of wednesday's gain, closing at $11.99, down $1.91, or 14%, in 4 p.m. new york stock exchange composite trading. with many enron bonds trading at two-thirds of their par value, bondholders didn't seem comforted either. 
enron has been in a defensive posture since it announced a third-quarter loss of $618 million two weeks ago, followed by news that it also took a $1.2 billion equity write-down, based partly on transactions involving a handful of its own officers. the company replaced its chief financial officer, andrew fastow, after the securities and exchange commission began an inquiry into related-party transactions. enron on wednesday disclosed that the inquiry had been elevated to a formal probe.

enron's shares fall and debt rating is cut

c. 2001 new york times company

dallas, nov. 1 -- with investors absorbing news of a formal securities and exchange commission investigation and a downgrading by another large credit-rating agency, shares of the enron corporation fell 13.7 percent today, giving back most of the gains from wednesday's rally. 
late on wednesday, enron, the energy-trading giant based in houston, said the s.e.c. had intensified its inquiry into the company's finances, making it a formal investigation, carrying subpoena power.
and today, standard & poor's lowered its rating on enron's senior debt by one notch, leaving it a few notches above junk bond status. the downgrading came after a similar cut by moody's investors service on monday. s.& p. left enron under review for a possible further downgrading. 
if enron's credit rating were dropped below investment grade, it could force the company to issue millions of shares of stock to satisfy debts and prompt other big energy-trading concerns to curtail their business with enron. 
s.& p. said that the company's ''financial flexibility has continued to diminish'' and that it had been unable ''to calm investors that are unsure about the strength of enron's core energy marketing business.'' but the rating agency also said it thought that ''enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty'' and that, so far, ''most counterparties have maintained their trading activity with enron.'' 
this morning, enron said it had obtained $1 billion in additional financing. the line of credit may help the company convince investors and trading partners that it can weather this crisis. but some industry officials said investors might have reacted negatively because enron had to pledge assets from two subsidiaries, northern natural gas and transwestern pipeline, to secure the credit line. 
an enron spokeswoman said that she did not know what interest rates the credit lines carried and that the company had no plans to seek even more financing deals. 
enron's shares have fallen by more than half in the last two weeks because of the s.e.c. investigation and worries about off-balance-sheet debts and transactions with investment partnerships involving the company's former chief financial officer, andrew s. fastow, who was ousted last week. enron shares fell $1.91 today, to $11.99. 
some analysts are beginning to attribute a swift recent rally in natural gas prices in part to the possibility that a collapse of enron would roil the commodity markets. enron dominates natural gas and electricity trading in the united states. 
in new york today, natural gas for december delivery fell 0.1 cent, to $3.29 for a million british thermal units. the contract has soared from about $2.70 over the last two weeks as enron's troubles became public. 
''enron has a massive exposure to both the buy side and the sell side in gas and other commodities,'' said jay saunders, oil and gas analyst at deutsche banc alex. brown, ''and if they're at risk financially, then you're exposed to that so you want to cover that risk. anybody who has enron as a counterparty in a trade might be concerned about getting paid.'' 
mr. saunders added that other factors had also lifted prices lately, including falling rates of gas being put in storage for use this winter.

california; metro desk
the state calpers is urged to challenge enron finance: the public employee pension fund holds 3 million shares of the energy firm, whose stock has plunged. state senator calls for action.

sacramento -- a state senator has encouraged the managers of california's public employee retirement fund to challenge, perhaps with a lawsuit, the management of enron corp., the high-flying energy company whose stock has plummeted more than 80% in the last year. 
the california public employee retirement system, the nation's biggest public pension fund, owns roughly 3 million shares of enron common stock. enron shares, once valued at nearly $85, fell $1.91 thursday to $11.99 on the new york stock exchange.
sen. steve peace (d-el cajon) urged management of calpers to deal aggressively with the houston-based company, which is being investigated by the securities and exchange commission for a potential conflict of interest by its former chief financial officer. 
investors have begun complaining of a paucity of information released by enron about its financial transactions, and the stock has fallen dramatically in response. on thursday, a major credit agency, standard & poor's, lowered its ratings on enron, dealing the company another financial blow. 
""it is clear that the events surrounding enron have created a serious lack of confidence in the judgment of enron's management team,"" peace wrote tuesday in a letter to calpers chief executive james e. burton. ""it is, therefore, incumbent on calpers, as trustee of public employees' ownership rights and as founder of the corporate governance movement, to improve enron's corporate governance to increase share value."" 
in an interview, peace said calpers should consider a shareholder lawsuit or join with other shareholders to force out enron's management. calpers provides retirement and health benefits to more than 1.2 million state and local public employees and their families. 
enron officials did not respond to a request for comment on peace's letter. calpers officials said they were considering the letter. 
peace has clashed repeatedly with enron since the early 1990s, when the company was trying to influence the utility regulators and lawmakers forging a plan to turn california's regulated electricity industry into a competitive market. peace chaired the legislative committee that crafted deregulation legislation. 
""enron wants a market where consumers have limited knowledge, and they want to operate their business where stockholders have the most limited information possible,"" peace said in an interview. 
once a natural gas pipeline company, enron has grown into the world's largest energy trader. 
besides owning enron stock, calpers has joined with the firm to invest in energy development. 
in 1993, calpers and enron each contributed $250 million to an investment fund guided by enron. when calpers ended the partnership in 1997 and sold its position to enron, it earned $125 million, a 23% return, a calpers spokesman said. they teamed up again in 1998, with each putting up $500 million for energy industry investments. enron tapped $150 million of calpers' money before calpers' commitment to the partnership expired.

enron gets loan -- at a price
enron received a $1 billion loan from j.p. morgan chase and salomon smith barney but had to pledge its natural gas pipelines as collateral. pledging the pipelines signals enron's desperation to convince shareholders and trading partners that it's creditworthy as the securities and exchange commission investigates partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, investors said. questions about enron's dealings with the partnerships have shut it out of commercial-paper markets, where most large corporations go to find low-interest, short-term debt.

companies & finance the americas: enron's dominant position is fuelling fears for markets: john labate and julie earle consider the implications of the company's woes: 
financial times; nov 2, 2001
by julie earle and john labate

nothing has added to enron's growth more than its aggressive and dominant position in the trading markets for gas and electricity that the houston-based company helped to create. 
a decade-long series of bold and innovative moves by enron has not only changed the company but transformed the way us energy companies manage risk and trade energy products from region to region. 
on any given day enron is the principal in about 25 per cent of the online and offline trades in the energy and natural gas markets, according to analysts' estimates. 
with an ongoing investigation by us securities regulators into enron's accounting and disclosure practices, and enron's market value falling by half in the past two weeks, many are wondering what impact enron's mounting troubles could have on the trading markets. 
analysts say that in the worst case, long-term scenarios, if enron's debt is downgraded to junk status or if the company depletes its considerable cash resources, the energy and natural gas markets could be hit in multiple ways. 
""if you have something as big as enron in a space saying they have no more money, you would have real effects and volatility in the market,"" said todd shipman, an analyst at credit rating agency standard & poor's. 
few competitors want to see enron exit the trading markets, however, since it provides so much liquidity to the markets, and fewer expect that to happen. 
many of enron's energy rivals, including dynegy, aquila and duke energy, are also trading partners, or counterparties to enron. as such they may be closely tied to enron's fate in the short term. 
the biggest near-term threat is if there is another change in enron's credit status. 
this week moody's investors service downgraded enron to two notches above junk status. further reductions are, for the moment, the main worry among its rivals and trading partners, although enron debt remains at investment-grade levels. 
""certainly, whenever anybody is downgraded to junk status, their counterparties become concerned about how much credit they will extend,"" said gerald keenan, a partner at pwc consulting in chicago. 
""everyone is re-evaluating their credit exposure to enron but few companies have stopped trading with it. 
""it is often the counterparty of choice since it makes markets in areas where there is not a lot of liquidity."" 
enron's trading partners are believed so far not to have changed the terms on their existing contracts with enron. 
however, if enron's financial status worsens, the lack of confidence could have its own negative impact on the energy trading markets. 
existing market hedges between these multiple firms in the markets could begin to unwind, analysts warn, which could add to short-term instability in the energy marketplace. 
it is unlikely, however, that energy prices would be hit since terms would quickly be renegotiated and stability return to the trading markets. 
any change in ownership in enron could bring stability to the trading markets, say analysts.

companies & finance the americas: dollars 1bn line of credit secured to pay debt 
financial times; nov 2, 2001
by robert clow and sheila mcnulty

enron, the troubled us energy trading group, has secured a dollars 1bn credit line with jp morgan chase and citigroup arm, salomon smith barney. 
enron's management signalled last weekend that it expected to raise more cash to supplement the dollars 3.3bn it received last week from drawing down its bank lines. 
the new loan will be secured against the assets of enron's northern natural gas company and transwestern pipeline. the proceeds will pay down maturing debt and increase short-term funds. 
enron declined to comment on the terms and conditions of the deal, saying it was not yet closed. 
on octoberm, 16 enron management announced a dollars 1.01bn charge and a dollars 1.2bn reduction of shareholders equity as a result of off-balance sheet private equity transactions set up by andrew fastow, its former chief financial officer. 
those deals raised questions about whether mr fastow was acting in the best interests of enron's other shareholders, which became the basis for a securities and exchange commission investigation. 
if the credit rating agencies downgrade the company's debt further, counterparties might increase the collateral they require to trade with enron. that could squeeze the embattled company's profit margins still further. 
it is not yet clear how the rating agencies will react to enron borrowing against its pipeline assets. their stable revenues have been one of the cornerstones of enron's rating. 
in an effort to safeguard its ratings, a senior management delegation told all the rating agencies on wednesday that it was going to be retreating from risk taking. 
""we are going to explore new markets,"" the company said. ""but what we have learned that we can expand into new markets without making large expenditures."" www.ft.com/energy

enron gets $1 billion more 
pledging assets, credit downgrade bruise shares 
by laura goldberg 
copyright 2001 houston chronicle 
enron corp.'s bid to shore up investor confidence by announcing it had lined up $1 billion in credit didn't succeed thursday. 
shares in houston's largest company closed down $1.91 at $11.99. and that was before a second rating agency downgraded enron's credit ratings. 
the action by standard & poor's wasn't a surprise to wall street and isn't likely to help enron's sagging shares. 
enron, the world's largest energy trader, said thursday morning it had reached a deal with the investment banking units of citigroup and j.p. morgan chase & co. for $1 billion in credit lines to be backed by a significant portion of enron's pipeline assets. 
last week, enron tapped into a $3.3 billion revolving credit line that wasn't secured by collateral. it banked about $1.1 billion and is using the rest to pay off short-term debt obligations. 
investors reacted thursday to several pieces of news. 
one was wednesday night's disclosure by enron that federal securities regulators are formally investigating business dealings between enron and investment partnerships formerly run by andrew fastow, who enron removed last week as chief financial officer. 
since enron revealed two financial hits related to the investment partnerships on oct. 16, wall street has raised an expanding number of questions about its financial health. some investors also saw the fact that enron's new credit will be asset-backed as negative. 
""what it tells you is that now they have to start using the crown jewels as security,"" said donald coxe, chairman of harris investment management, where the harris insight equity fund owns about 78,000 shares in enron. ""any royal family which has to pledge the crown and scepter to get a loan in the private markets tends to be about three days from the republicans breaking down the barriers of the palaces."" 
but enron spokesman mark palmer said using the assets as collateral meant enron could get the credit negotiated quickly. 
""it has to do with speed,"" he said, adding that enron sought to reassure outsiders its balance sheet is strong and that it has available cash to support its core energy trading business. 
of the new credit, which is expected to be finalized shortly, $250 million will be used to pay off debt obligation that's about to mature. the rest will be available as cash, palmer said. 
the assets of its northern natural gas co. and transwestern pipeline co., the collateral enron pledged could support another $200 million in credit if need be, he said, adding that enron didn't believe it needed more than $1 billion. 
enron, which transformed itself from a pipeline company to a trader in everything from electricity to paper, still has about 25,000 miles of pipelines. the two assets pledged represent more than 19,000 miles of that. 
monday, moody's investors service downgraded enron's long-term debt one level to a rating that's still two notches above what are commonly called junk bonds. 
thursday, standard & poor's did the equivalent. it is also downgraded enron's short-term ratings and said it was reviewing the company for potential additional downgrades. 
if enron's credit ratings fall from investment grade to junk status, it will trigger a wave negative consequences, including some that would damage its trading business. 
part of enron's purpose in setting up new credit is to help it keep an investment-grade rating. 
in its report, s&p said it downgraded enron because it believes the company's plans, including asset sales, won't be enough to warrant the credit rating enron had. it expressed concerns that enron could face some permanent erosion of its share of the energy trading market if its main competitors take advantage of its weakened state and could have trouble keeping key personnel. 
carol coale, a stock analyst with prudential securities in houston, said in a report thursday that enron may need to issue 120 million new shares or more ""to keep the rating agencies at bay."" 


usa: wrapup 2-enron lines up cash to soothe worried wall street.
by jeff franks

reuters english news service
(c) reuters limited 2001.

houston, nov 1 (reuters) - enron corp., gathering money to soothe a worried wall street, lined up $1 billion of new credit on thursday, then saw its credit rating cut for a second time this week as the nation's largest energy trader struggled to restore investor confidence shaken by questionable financial transactions. 
shares in the houston-based company, whose dealings are under investigation by the u.s. securities and exchange commission, tumbled $1.91, or 13.7 percent, to $11.99 as the market continued a two-week-long pummeling of the stock.
at issue are off-the-balance sheet deals with limited partnerships, run by then-chief financial officer andrew fastow, which contributed to a $1 billion charge against third quarter earnings and a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity announced on oct. 16. angry investors say enron has not fully explained the transactions or whether it faces more liabilities. 
the company, taking the tack that an having abundance of money available would ease fears about its financial stability, said on thursday it got $1 billion in credit lines from j.p. morgan chase & co. and salomon smith barney inc., the investment banking arm of citigroup inc. 
the new credit, which comes on top of $3.3 billion in lines that enron tapped last week, came with the proviso that the company's gas and pipeline assets be put up as collateral, a measure usually reserved for firms with ""junk"" credit ratings. 
allay fears 
but a grateful ken lay, enron's chairman and chief executive, thanked the two wall street institutions for their support and said the credit infusion should help allay investors' fears. 
""we very much appreciate the support of two of our long-standing banking partners,"" he said in a statement. ""with more than $1 billion in cash currently on our balance sheet, this additional credit capacity will further solidify enron's standing as the leading market maker in wholesale energy markets."" 
the good news was tempered later in the day by standard & poor's announcement that it had cut enron's credit rating and could do so again if the situation worsens. 
the rating agency cut enron's corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to ""bbb,"" two notches above junk status, from ""bbb-plus,"" its subordinated debt rating to ""bbb-minus"" from ""bbb,"" and its commercial paper rating to ""a-3"" from ""a-2."" 
it also downgraded ratings for several enron share trusts. 
downgrades could make it harder for enron to issue debt and run its day-to-day business as fellow marketers and traders demand more collateral. if the ratings fall to junk, or below investment-grade, enron could be forced to issue more shares, analysts said. 
s&p said it cut the ratings because of questions about whether enron was taking sufficient action to fully restore its credit quality. 
""the company's financial flexibility has continued to diminish. this crisis of investor confidence can be traced ... directly to the company's inability to calm investors that are unsure about the strength of enron's core energy marketing business and the viability of the company's plan to restore its credit profile,"" it said. 
full disclosure 
""a full, frank disclosure and discussion of the business and financial issues facing the company and its plans to address them will be necessary before investors will be able to confidently evaluate the merits of investing in enron securities,"" the agency added. 
s&p nevertheless said enron's liquidity position is ""adequate"" to see the company through its current problems and that enron was unlikely to see its position as the industry's top energy marketer endangered as long as it operated transparently. 
on monday, moody's investors service cut enron's long-term debt to ""baa2,"" also two notches above junk, and warned it may cut that rating and enron's ""prime-2"" commercial paper rating. 
enron was once a wall street darling lauded for its ability to create new internet-based commodity markets that produced soaring profits and a stock price that seemed to defy gravity. 
but setbacks in its bandwidth business and overseas investments, plus problems arising from the california power crisis hurt its do-no-wrong image. and in august, former chief executive jeff skilling shocked the financial world by resigning after just six months on the job, citing personal reasons. 
the stock, whose year-high was $84, began to sink, then fell off a cliff after the company's oct. 16 announcement. that day, shares closed at $33.84. 
trying to shore up its credibility, enron replaced fastow last week with another enron executive, jeff mcmahon. 
the company said on wednesday an sec ""informal inquiry"" begun oct. 22 had become a formal investigation, possibly indicating regulators did not like what they had seen. it elected university of texas law school dean william powers to the board of directors and put him in charge of an internal probe into the deals. 
despite all the bad news of recent weeks, enron said on thursday its core business of energy trading was going strong. 
enron spokesman eric thode said transactions on the houston-based company's widely watched internet enrononline system were averaging some $3 billion to $4 billion a day, up from a 30-day average of $2.5 billion. 
enron is by far the nation's largest natural gas and electricity trader, with industry analysts estimating it is involved in some 25 percent of daily trade in those markets.

(copyright 2001 by the chicago tribune)

troubled enron corp. said thursday it has secured $1 billion in new financing, but then saw its credit rating cut for the second time this week and watched its stock price take another dive. 
enron said it got $1 billion in credit lines from j.p. morgan chase & co. and salomon smith barney inc., but had to put up its natural gas and pipeline assets as collateral.
standard & poor's cut its ratings for enron, downgrading its corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to bbb, two notches above junk status. earlier this week, moody's investors service downgraded the company's long-term debt. 
enron shares dropped nearly 14 percent, or $1.91 per share, to close at $11.99 on the new york stock exchange. after dropping to a nine-year low tuesday, shares of the nation's largest natural gas and power marketer rose 25 percent wednesday amid speculation the company was a takeover candidate. 
but after the markets closed wednesday, enron announced the securities and exchange commission had opened an investigation into possible conflicts of interest. the sec is apparently looking into dealings enron had with partnerships led by its former chief financial officer, andrew fastow, who was forced out last week. 
late wednesday, enron said it created a special committee headed by university of texas law school dean william powers to respond to the sec investigation. powers also was elected to enron's board of directors.

india ongc plans enron oil,gas field bid if bg deal fails

11/02/2001

singapore -(dow jones)- india's state-owned oil & natural gas corp. (p.ong) said friday that it would consider bidding for enron corp.'s (ene) upstream indian assets if u.k.-based bg group plc's (brg) conditional acquisition of the assets collapses. 
bg paid $388 million for enron's 30% stake in oil and gas fields offshore western india, but the sale is subject to a number of consents and conditions including confirmation from enron and gas india's joint venture partners - ongc and reliance industries ltd. (p.rel) - that bg will inherit field operator status from enron.
ongc and reliance industries are challenging bg's goal of acquiring enron's operatorship of the offshore tapti gas field and the panna/mukti oil and gas field. bg have made it clear it would walk away from the deal if it didn't get outright operatorship. 
""if bg wants to walk away, we'll come up with a plan. if they (enron) offer (an opportunity to bid again), yes, then we will think about it,"" an ongc spokesman told dow jones newswires, without elaborating further. 
earlier this year, ongc bid a reported $400 million for enron's indian oil and gas assets, only to have its bid rejected. analysts at the time said enron was unlikely to settle for anything less than $600 million for its stake in the venture. 
ongc and reliance industries jointly hold a 70% stake in the assets. 
as reported thursday, bg said it will extend the negotiation period on the operatorship of the fields for an unspecified period. 
however, analysts say bg's bid for operator status will continue to face stiff resistance from ongc and reliance. 
""we want the operatorship,"" the ongc spokesman reiterated. 
enron's upstream oil and gas assets in india hold proven and probable reserves of around 170 million barrels of oil equivalent.

enron may sell india dabhol power shr at discount-lender
by himendra kumar
of dow jones newswires

11/02/2001
dow jones international news

new delhi -(dow jones)- u.s. energy company enron corp. (ene) may sell its equity in india's 2,184 megawatt dabhol power co. plant at a discount given its financial woes back home, a senior official of the industrial development bank of india (p.idb) told dow jones newswires. 
""there's a possibility of enron selling its equity in dabhol real cheap because that company desperately needs cash. anything below $500 million will be a good price to pay for their dabhol stake,"" said the idbi official.
india's banks and financial institutions have a total exposure of about $1.4 billion in the dabhol power plant, located in the western india state of maharashtra. idbi's own exposure in dabhol is in excess of 20 billion rupees ($1=inr48.00). 
enron has a controlling 65% equity stake in dabhol and wants to sell it because of payment defaults by the plant's sole customer - the maharashtra state electricity board - and the indian federal government's failure to honor payment guarantees. back in august the u.s. company said it was willing to sell its equity at cost. 
enron india spokesman jimmy mogal confirmed that dabhol power co. was currently in talks with the government and indian financial institutions but declined to say what price enron was seeking. 
""dpc continues to hold discussions with the government of india and indian financial institutions regarding the sale of foreign sponsor equity in the dabhol project. it would not be appropriate to elaborate further on the recurring media speculation with respect to the status of these buyout discussions,"" mogal said in a faxed reply to questions. 
""while we remain hopeful for an amicable resolution of this issue, dpc continues to pursue the available legal remedies under the contract documents in order to protect the interests of dpc's stake holder,"" he added. 
r.k. pachauri, director of the independent think tank tata energy research institute, said the time was right for a company to negotiate a bargain from cash-strapped enron for its dabhol equity. 
""even $700 million would be a good price. all said and done, dabhol is a world class project. people now need to get their act together and settle for a deal since the time is fast running out,"" pachauri said. 
the houston-based enron is attempting to persuade banks to provide additional credit to bolster its financial position after a precipitous fall in its share price. last week, the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion in credit after it encountered difficulties in raising funds in the commercial paper market. 
the idbi official said enron's indian lenders don't see any logic in buying out its equity in dabhol because they don't want a non-performing asset. 
but he said one possible option being talked about was the state-owned company national thermal power corp. (p.ntp) buying enron's stake. 
""the government has to decide fast who will buy this equity. a state-owned company like the national thermal power corp., which has core competence in the power sector, may be asked to buy enron's stake. later, ntpc can always resell it at a higher price,"" the official said. 
local newspapers say india's privately-owned bses ltd. (p.bsx) and tata power co. ltd. (p.tpw) may also be interested in buying out enron's dabhol stake. 
no tata power official was immediately available for comment and a bses official declined to comment when reached by dow jones newswires. 
the idbi official said he hoped the government will take a decision before nov. 9 when the indian prime minister atal bihari vajpayee visits the u.s. to attend the u.n. general assembly meeting in new york. 
he said enron may send a final contract termination notice to mseb any time after nov. 19 and then the dispute will have to be settled by the court of arbitration in london. 
""should india lose the case, it may have to pay enron damages ranging anywhere between $4 billion-$5 billion. enron has a history of not losing any litigation,"" he warned. 
local media reports over the past two months have said enron wants $1.00 billion for its stake in dabhol. 
a senior india power ministry official said the government favored an early solution to the dabhol crisis but added that no decision had been taken yet on who would buy enron's equity. 
""we are committed toward resolving the dabhol dispute amicably. talks are on and nothing definite has been decided yet. but i am hopeful, the dispute will end on a happy note, sometime very soon,"" said the government official. 
dabhol is india's largest single foreign investment. mseb has 15%, while general electric co. (ge) and bechtel (x.btl) own 10% each.

`buying out enron's stake in dabhol unit won't help'

11/02/2001
the times of india
copyright (c) 2001 the times of india; source: world reporter (tm)

mumbai: buying out enron's stake in the dabhol power company (dpc) is no resolution since the tariff will still be unviable, analysts say. 
even as enron corp is preparing to sell off its stake in the project to indian financial institutions, who have lent huge sums to the project, experts say a buy-out would make sense only if the bid for enron's share of $ 1.3 billion is discounted to under $ 500 million and the loan component is written off by at least $ 500 million, says convenor of the enron virodhi andolan, pradyumna kaul.
``the project will continue to be unviable even after buying it at low cost,'' mr kaul asserts. ``if lng is the fuel, the energy price will still be more than rs 2 per unit, given the fact that oil will be more than 25 per barrel. this will ensure that the unit cost of power will never be less than rs 3.20,'' he says. 
at the moment, enron is willing to sell power at rs 3.60 per unit at 90 per cent offtake, he points out. but this is not possible because a high offtake will not be permitted by the maharashtra electricity regulatory commission in the absence of demand. the merc has told the state eletricity board to buy costliest power the last. ``and at a low offtake, the plant will be grossly unviable,'' an expert says. 
apart from buying enron's stake at a low cost, it is necessary to reduce interest rates from indian fis, slash customs duty and sales tax on fuel, he says. these are some of the demands that dpc has already placed before the govermment. ``even if the plant is sold, these factors will hike up the cost,'' he said. 
another alternative is to use the plant for peaking load alone, to be used only during a few hours of the day. this would bring down costs, anti-enron activist abhay mehta said. in practical terms, he said, the only player to benefit from a sale is enron corp which is desperately looking to sell its stake. 
such a prospect leaves some grey areas about the future of the judicial inquiry ordered recently by the democratic front government. the probe is yet to get under way and the supreme court case against the project is pending hearing. 
while officials admit that legally the actions will continue, it will not be as effective as if the company is still in the field. it is also possible to come to a mutually acceptable settlement before enron exits the country or speed up the actions, they say. 
``these repercussions are secondary; the moot point is a speedy solution to the enron issue,'' says an official. 
mr mehta says the fact that chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already agreed to an extension for the judicial probe beyond six months, ``if it is found necessary'' suggests that the government ``is not really serious about solving the issue but will rather keep dragging the case till the chickens come home to roost and some political points are scored.'' 
``the state government's attitude is like that of an ostrich: if you ignore a problem long enough, it will go away,'' he says.

dabhol lenders' meet in london cancelled

the meeting of the lenders of the enron-promoted dabhol power project scheduled for november 2 and 3 in london has been cancelled. 
this was supposed to be the last meeting of the lenders before the november 19 deadline by which the dabhol power company is required to fire its final termination notice.
sources in the domestic as well as the global lenders consortium confirmed the cancellation of the meeting, but gave conflicting reasons for this. some domestic lenders maintained that the meeting was postponed because a solution to the dabhol problem was in sight. ""the government is working out a solution to the problem along with the domestic financial institutions,"" they said. 
""it only makes sense to meet after the solution is worked out,"" said a source in the domestic lenders consortium. 
this was sharply contested by a source in the foreign lenders consortium who said that the industrial development bank of india (idbi) chairman & managing director p p vohra and icici chief executive officer k v kamath were to attend the meeting, but their last minute engagements resulted in the cancellation of the meeting.

usa: critics question andersen's handling of enron.
by kevin drawbaugh

11/01/2001
reuters english news service
(c) reuters limited 2001.

washington, nov 1 (reuters) - andersen, a top accounting firm, should have done more as auditor for energy giant enron corp. to alert investors to certain partnerships tied to the company that are now being investigated by u.s. authorities, accounting experts said on thursday. 
as the houston-based energy trading group dealt with a deepening crisis, critics of its auditor andersen said the accountants should have pushed harder for more and clearer disclosure of the partnerships' potential for conflicts of interest and financial risk to enron.
""not only is the disclosure seemingly inadequate as to where it's put, it's inadequate as to the attention that's paid to it. then thirdly, it's almost unintelligible,"" said mark cheffers, who heads massachusetts-based accounting consultancy accountingmalpractice.com, in an interview. 
enron, whose share price slumped again on thursday, said on wednesday that it was being investigated by the securities and exchange commission, the top u.s. financial markets regulator. an sec spokesman declined to comment. 
enron last month ousted its chief financial officer andrew fastow, who was instrumental in setting up and managing certain outside partnerships that have been linked to the sec probe. 
enron's ties to the partnerships were disclosed in enron reports to the sec and investors. andersen, based in chicago, audited those reports and approved them as fair and complete. 
asked about criticisms of the job the firm did, andersen spokesman patrick dorton said: ""we are committed to quality auditing and protecting the investor interest. knowledgeable parties are looking at these matters. we're not going to respond to speculative commentary."" 
enron disclosed in its march 2001 proxy statement that in the year 2000 it paid andersen $25 million in auditor fees, as well as $27 million in fees for various other work. 
enron - a former natural gas pipeline group that transformed itself into the nation's largest energy trader - saw its stock close down on thursday near an eight-year low, having lost two-thirds of its value since mid-october. 
investors began dumping enron shares after reports of off-the-balance sheet transactions involving two limited partnerships run by fastow, who was replaced last week by another enron executive, jeff mcmahon. 
fastow's dual role seen at heart of controversy 
how fastow could have balanced his duties as enron cfo with his role as head of the partnerships - which regularly did business with enron - is the key question, sources said. 
the partnerships - called ljm2 co-investment lp and ljm cayman lp - were set up expressly to do huge volumes of highly complex financial transactions wi???stow's employer. the transactions were disclosed to enron investors in annual 10k filings and pr???2000 and 2001. 
but andersen should have done more to put the disclosures in plain english and highlight their potential for possible conflicts and risk to enron's finances, said critics. 
enron last month said it was taking a $1 billion charge against earnings, as well as cutting shareholder equity by $1.2 billion due to transactions with the fastow-led entities. 
""a firm of andersen's magnitude and reputation should always be aware of such possibilities. they should be able to presuppose the what-ifs in any condition,"" said jay nisberg, an accounting consultant based in ridgefield, connecticut. 
an enron spokeswoman said andersen knew about the ljm partnerships. ""we made them aware of our transactions with the partnerships and they reviewed them to the extent they deemed necessary,"" said enron spokeswoman karen denne. 
even investors in the partnerships, which by most accounts were tremendously profitable, questioned how they were set up, with enron employee fastow at their head. 
one early investor in ljm2 was the arkansas teacher retirement system, a pension fund with $8 billion in assets. zz zz.

enron: online trading volume sees normal decline thursday

11/01/2001
dow jones energy service
(copyright (c) 2001, dow jones & company, inc.)

new york -(dow jones)- enron corp.'s (ene) electronic trading system, enrononline.com, saw a little more than 6,600 transactions thursday, down from wednesday's 7,100 transactions, enron spokesman eric thode said. 
the decline is typical of a reduction in energy trading activity at the beginning of the month, said thode, who added that enrononline volume oct. 1 was 5,200 deals. as in the past two weeks, the volume of transactions thursday exceeded the 30-day average volume of about 5,600 daily transactions.
""all companies were transacting that we would expect to be transacting,"" thode said. 
on thursday, energy traders said enrononline, on which enron is the counterparty for all deals, was less active. at one key western electricity hub, palo verde, ariz., enrononline's bid to buy power for delivery in december was $34.35 a megawatt-hour, compared with the best bid of $34.50 a megawatt-hour on the intercontinentalexchange, a competing internet-based trading system. eol's offer to sell the same contract was 35 cents higher. eol's bid-offer spreads were also wider for northeast power and western gas at midday thursday, though they were competitive for northeast gas. 
generally, eol presents tighter spreads in its key markets than the spreads found either on competing electronic systems or in the phone-broker market. those aggressive bids have helped propel volumes on eol since its inception in november 1999. 
""spreads fluctuate based on the markets. every company has different perceptions,"" thode said when asked about the narrower spreads on eol. 
""the power market for the past two weeks has been fairly quiet. there's been little volatility. gas markets fairly volatile, and the increased volumes have come from primarily natural gas markets,"" thode said.

power supplier enron's stock drops another 14 percent
by mark babineck

copyright 2001. the associated press. all rights reserved.

houston (ap) - troubled enron corp. said thursday it has secured $1 billion in new financing, using its natural gas and pipeline assets as collateral. but its stock price took another dive after rising a day earlier on takeover speculation. 
in trading thursday on the new york stock exchange, enron shares fell nearly 14 percent, or $1.91 a share, to $11.99.
after dropping to a nine-year low on tuesday, shares of the nation's largest natural gas and power marketer rose 25 percent wednesday amid speculation the houston-based company was a takeover candidate. 
but after the stock market closed for the day, enron, an important supplier to power-starved california, announced the securities and exchange commission had opened a formal investigation into possible conflicts of interest. 
the sec is apparently looking into dealings enron had with partnerships led by its former chief financial officer, andrew fastow, who was forced out last month as investors fled because of questions about the arrangements. 
while referring to the latest sec news as ""noise,"" merrill lynch analyst donato j. eassey said it would subdue enron's stock price. 
""we believe the timing and directional uncertainty of this new development will at best cap enron's stock price in the mid-teens while increasing overall volatility,"" eassey said in a note thursday. 
late wednesday, enron said it created a special committee headed by university of texas law school dean william powers to respond to the sec investigation. powers also was elected to enron's board of directors. 
""i have asked the board to take this action to address fully and forthrightly investors' questions and concerns,"" said enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l. lay. ""we will also make every appropriate public disclosure during the course of the sec's investigation."" 
however, duane grubert, an analyst with sanford c. bernstein and co. in new york, said enron still has much to do to restore investor confidence. 
""with (stock) values this low, you've got two camps of investors: guys that hate enron and guys that want to be cautiously attracted to enron,"" grubert said. ""it's led to the trading range being irrationally low and shares being oversold. it's not something the company wants."" 
enron's stock has skidded since the company reported a $638 million third quarter loss just over two weeks ago, dragged down by a one-time charge of $1.01 billion attributed to various losses. some of these losses have been tied to partnerships managed by fastow, who was ousted last week. 
earlier this week, moody's investors service downgraded the company's long-term debt and warned of possible further downgrades. 
on tuesday, shares hit a nine-year low of $11.16. with such a depressed stock price, the wall street journal reported that enron was being eyed as a possible takeover target. 
potential buyers include general electric's ge capital unit, warren buffett's berkshire hathaway and royal dutch shell, the journal said.

usa: update 1-s&p cuts enron ratings, may cut ratings again.

11/01/2001
reuters english news service
(c) reuters limited 2001.

new york, nov 1 (reuters) - standard & poor's on thursday cut its ratings for embattled energy trader enron corp. and warned it may cut the ratings again because of what it described as ""uncertainties"" surrounding the company and the possibility it may face further problems in the capital markets. 
houston-based enron said on wednesday it is being probed by the securities and exchange commission.
downgrades could make it tougher for enron to issue debt and run its day-to-day business as fellow marketers and traders demand more collateral. if the ratings fall to junk, or below investment-grade, enron could be forced to issue more shares. 
s&p cut enron's corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to ""bbb,"" two notches above junk status, from ""bbb-plus,"" its subordinated debt rating to ""bbb-minus"" from ""bbb,"" and its commercial paper rating to ""a-3"" from ""a-2."" 
the rating agency also downgraded ratings for several enron share trusts. 
s&p warned it may cut all of these ratings again. a downgrade to the commercial paper rating would take that rating to junk status. all leading u.s. rating agencies, including s&p, generally rate all of a company's senior unsecured debt and commercial paper either investment-grade or junk. 
s&p nevertheless said enron's liquidity position is ""adequate"" to see the company through its current problems. 
so long as enron provides market participants with their usual liquidity and price transparency, it said, ""it is unlikely that any significant long-term damage to enron's franchise as the premier energy marketer will be sustained."" 
the s&p analyst who covers enron was not immediately available for further comment. 
on monday, moody's investors service cut enron's long-term debt to ""baa2,"" also two notches above junk, and warned it may cut that rating and enron's ""prime-2"" commercial paper rating. 
enron shares closed thursday on the new york stock exchange at $11.99, down $1.91, or 13.7 percent. they have fallen 65 percent since oct. 16, when enron said it would take $1.01 billion in charges for certain investments. the shares hit a nine-year low on tuesday. 
""crisis of investor confidence"" 
s&p said enron's plan to sell assets and use other means to repair its ""damaged balance sheet"" will be ""insufficient"" to restore its historical ""bbb-plus"" ratings. 
""this crisis of investor confidence can be traced ... directly to the company's inability to calm investors that are unsure about the strength of enron's core energy marketing business and the viability of the company's plan to restore its credit profile,"" it said. 
""a full, frank disclosure and discussion of the business and financial issues facing the company and its plans to address them will be necessary before investors will be able to confidently evaluate the merits of investing in enron securities,"" s&p added. 
enron said on thursday it obtained $1 billion in secured credit lines in a bid to help support day-to-day trading operations and bolster investor confidence. 
""we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating,"" said jeffrey mcmahon, who last week became enron's new chief financial officer, in a statement issued on thursday.

enron's credit rating cut after $1 bln loan secured (update9)
2001-11-01 18:27 (new york)

enron's credit rating cut after $1 bln loan secured (update9)

     (adds company comment in 17th to 19th paragraphs.)

     houston, nov. 1 (bloomberg) -- enron corp., the largest
energy trader, received a $1 billion loan from j.p. morgan chase &
co. and salomon smith barney inc. after agreeing to use the
company's natural-gas pipelines as collateral.

     enron shares fell 14 percent a day after the u.s. securities
and exchange commission began formally investigating partnerships
run by its former chief financial officer. pledging the pipelines
signals enron's desperation to convince shareholders and trading
partners that it's creditworthy, investors said.

     ``it's not reassuring, it's worrisome,'' said donald coxe,
manager of the harris insight equity fund, which owns about 78,000
enron shares. ``if they had to secure the loan, obviously the
lenders don't think they can rely on enron's financial
statements.''

     standard & poor's said after u.s. markets closed that it cut
enron's long-term credit rating to ``bbb,'' the second-lowest
investment grade, from ``bbb+.'' its short-term debt rating was
cut to ``a-3,'' one grade above junk status, from ``a-2.'

     the sec is investigating partnerships run by former cfo
andrew fastow that bought and sold enron shares and assets. those
trades cost enron $35 million and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder
equity. questions about enron's dealings with the partnerships
have shut it out of commercial-paper markets, where most large
corporations go to find low-interest, short-term debt.

     last friday, enron tapped a $3 billion credit line to pay off
$2.2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding. proceeds from
the $1 billion secured loan will go for debt payments and to
supplement cash reserves, enron said.

                        business with enron

     to get the $1 billion loan, enron pledged assets of its
northern natural gas co. and transwestern pipeline co., which own
gas pipeline systems that combined are about 19,000 miles long and
can deliver as much as 6 billion cubic feet of gas a day.

     enron, based in houston, got its start as a natural gas-
pipeline operator. over the past decade, the company has shed
assets such as pipelines and power plants and focused on trading
electricity, gas, wood pulp and other commodities.

     enron now accounts for about a quarter of u.s. power and gas
trades. the company still has about 25,000 miles of gas pipeline.

     mortgaging those lines is ``maybe not such a good signal,''
said roger hamilton, who manages john hancock value funds, which
owns 600,000 enron shares. ``it shows they can't convince banks
with anything but secured assets.''

     shares of enron fell $1.91 to $11.99. earlier, they dropped
to $11.70. the stock has fallen 86 percent this year.

     enron's 6.4 percent coupon notes due in 2006 fell about 3
cents today to be bid at 74 cents on the dollar and offered at 77
cents, traders said. until last week, the notes were trading near
par value.

                           credit rating

     enron must have investment-grade credit to borrow enough to
settle its transactions daily. energy companies including exelon
corp. and northeast utilities have restricted business with enron
as the company sought new sources of credit.

     on monday, moody's investors service lowered enron's long-
term credit rating to ``baa2'' from ``baa1,'' two notches above
junk status. it also placed the company's ``p-2'' rating for
commercial paper on review for possible downgrade.

     standard & poor's said in downgrading enron's credit rating
today that the company has enough liquidity to see it through the
``current period of uncertainty.'' still, s&p said, enron's
``financial flexibility has continued to diminish'' because of its
``inability to calm investors that are unsure about the strength
of enron's core energy marketing business.''

                         repayment trigger

     falling below investment grade would trigger early repayment
terms for $3.3 billion in bonds held by affiliated companies such
as the ones created by fastow. a lower credit rating also reduces
the amount of cash that enron can raise to back its trading
business.

     ``there are still two levels before those triggers go into
effect,'' enron spokeswoman karen denne said. the announcement of
today's $1 billion loan is ``the latest step in an orderly plan to
strengthen our balance sheet,'' she said. denne outlined three
steps, which include the credit line and a draw-down of $3 billion
in unsecured credit, which was announced last week.

     the final step is $2.1 billion in asset sales, which the
company outlined on a conference call last week. enron said it
expects to close on $600 million in sales before year's end.

     the sales include enron's azurix north america water business
to american water works inc. for $149.8 million, enron's puerto
rican power-plant company ecoelectrica holdings ltd. to mirant
corp. and enron's stake in brazilian natural-gas distributor cia.
distribuidora de gas do rio de janeiro to state-owned brazilian
oil company petroleo brasileiro sa, or petrobras. the latter two
transactions are valued at $250 million each, enron spokesman mark
palmer said.

     s&p said today it doesn't think the asset sales and enron's
other plans will be enough to restore enron's credit quality to
the ``bbb+'' level it had since 1995.

                        investor confidence

     the financing is to ``enhance market and investor
confidence,'' enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said
in a statement.

     enron can borrow another $200 million by bringing other banks
into the loan, denne said. ``we don't have any plans to do so at
this point,'' she said.

     ``we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet
and maintain our investment grade credit rating,'' mcmahon said.

     mcmahon, then head of enron's industrial markets group, was
named cfo last week. fastow was ousted in an attempt to restore
investor confidence.

     ``it seems until we know more about the sec investigation,
it's going to be a difficult time for the stock,'' said tara

usa: enron u.s. energy trade so far skirts credit woes.
by joseph silha

reuters english news service
(c) reuters limited 2001.

new york, nov 1 (reuters) - enron corp., whose shares slumped again on thursday amid investors' concerns over a credit crunch, has yet to see that fear seriously dent its dealings with other giants of the u.s. gas and power markets. 
""trading volumes in our core wholesale businesses remain extremely strong. every day this week, volume on enrononline has exceeded our rolling 30-day average. we are not seeing people hesitate to do business with us,"" enron spokesman eric thode said.
enron is by far the nation's largest natural gas and electricity trader, with industry analysts estimating it is involved in some 25 percent of daily trade in those markets. 
the company recently became the target of a securities and exchange commission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships headed by enron's former chief financial officer. 
thode said transactions on the houston-based company's widely watched internet enrononline system were averaging some $3 billion to $4 billion a day, up from a 30-day average of $2.5 billion. 
business as usual? 
while enron's dominance of the industry has long been a sore spot with competitors, many of its biggest trading partners said it was business as usual, despite an 80 percent plunge in the company's share price since january. 
but the drain on the company's capital has not gone unnoticed, prompting increased caution among traders but few fears the company will exit the north american energy market. 
""enron has come under closer scrutiny, but we haven't changed our policy about dealing with the company. this is a one time event. it's a hurricane, but it doesn't mean the weather next year will be bad. enron will handle this problem,"" al butkus, vice president at utilicorp united, said. 
butkus noted enron's problems stem from how the company financed the purchase of some assets, not from its trading operations. 
charlotte, n.c.-based duke energy, another large trading partner, also has not curbed its business with enron. 
""we have a credit process for our counterparties which tells us how much collateral is required. that could come into play if there were further problems with enron's credit, but we haven't seen that yet,"" duke energy spokesman terry francisco said. 
traders at reliant energy, williams cos., dynegy and el paso corp all said they continue to deal with enron but were closely monitoring the situation. 
credit squeeze 
despite the current calm among energy traders, analysts cautioned enron's shrinking capitalization could still squeeze its cash supply and hamper its ability to do business. 
questions about some off-balance sheet deals with two partnerships helped pummel the company's stock this week to its lowest level since 1992, shrinking market capitalization to less than $9 billion from more than $60 billion in january. 
most of enron's power and gas deals are in the unregulated over-the-counter (otc) market, so no one outside of the company knows what trades are on their books. 
but enron, the biggest market maker in energy products, has consistently preached a balanced or hedged book. 
""some people may be scaling back their dealings with enron, but i think you can rely on enron to do what they should do in risk management practices,"" ed krapels, director at massachusetts-based energy security analysis inc told reuters. 
""i think at the end of the day, their book was balanced enough and they should be able to weather the storm."" 
but krapels cautioned that further deterioration in enron's share price and credit standing might force the company to post larger cash deposits with its counterparties and ultimately restrict trading operations. 
earlier today, merrill lynch lowered its rating on enron's stock to ""neutral"" from ""accumulate"". 
enron's shares ended down $1.91, or 13.7 percent, at $11.99.

india press:dabhol creditors meeting in london called off

11/01/2001

(copyright (c) 2001, dow jones & company, inc.)

new delhi -(dow jones)- a meeting among creditors of india's dabhol power co. in london, originally scheduled for friday and saturday, has been cancelled, reports the business standard. 
according to some domestic lenders, the meeting was canceled because a solution to the dabhol's problems was in sight, the newspaper reports.
""the government is working out a solution to the problem along with the domestic financial institutions. it only makes sense to meet after the solution is worked out,"" the report quoted a source in the domestic lenders' consortium as saying. 
however, a source in the foreign lenders' consortium said last-minute engagements of leading executives in industrial development bank of india and icici resulted in the cancellation of the meeting. 
dabhol, a $2.9 billion, 2,184-megawatt power project located in the western indian state of maharashtra, is a unit of u.s. energy company enron corp. (ene). 
the project ran into trouble after dabhol's sole buyer, maharashtra state electricity board, refused to purchase power from the plant, saying the company's tariffs were ""exorbitant and unaffordable."" enron has threatened to sell its controlling 65% stake in dabhol following a long-standing payment dispute with mseb and india's federal government for its failure to honor a payment guarantee. 
dabhol is india's largest foreign investment to date. newspaper web site: www.business-standard.com

John --

To your point #3Burr --

Probably want to bring in Steve Montovano on the NC PUC question -- we have worked with a local lawyer in the past (I think her name is Allison Duncan) that could help with this question and demonstrate that having an RTO does NOT make a state deal with retail competition any sooner than it wants to deal with the question.  Steve Montovano could probably be of assistance here.  Maybe bring in Allison to DC to deal directly with the staff?

Subject:	Hill Meetings on RTOs


I had two interesting meetings yesterday afternoon with staff to key members of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee: Rep. Richard Burr (R-NC) and Rep. Chip Pickering (R-MS).  Terry Allen, one of our consultants, accompanied me.

In both meetings, I used to great effect the broad coalition that had filed with us in the Southeast RTO case against the North Carolina PUC stay request.  If you didn't see it -- there is a long article on the coalition and the filing in yesterday's Energy Daily, which I used with the staff to show the many groups that support what we need in the Southeast.  I am going to send them the filing itself as a follow up.

Burr is very important because he is the lead cosponor of the Sawyer-Burr bill that has voluntary RTO language and effectively a prohibition on mandatory RTOs.  Key points--

	1,	We had heard from a friend of Carin's in the Burr office that Burr and/or the staff did not have favorable view of Enron.  I checked with the head of the Duke office -- a personal friend of mine -- who said the staffer has friends who work for Southern.  However, at the meeting, the staffer said that Burr's office had had difficulties with prior Enron lobbyists no longer with the company and that they looked forward to a fresh start.

	2.	Burr's main interest is transmission legislation that provides incentives for more investment so Wall Street will look favorably on transmission.  His main interest is in the incentive pricing section.  He said the bill was put in as they left so could stake out an opening position before Barton releases a draft in September.  (This confirms Pat's observation that Burr likes to be a player.)

	3.	Staff said Burr has done interviews in which he said that a handful of RTOs are inevitable and desirable -- the question is how to get there.  To date, he has been most influenced by the NC PUC -- (Commissioner Ervin, son or grandson of the late Senator, is a family friend of the Burr staffer).  The PUC says that the FERC RTO plans for the SE would force NC to act on retail competition before 2006 -- which it is not in a position to do.  (We need to respond to this argument.)

	4.	Burr staff acknowledged that the final subcommittee-approved bill (if there is one), would move far in the direction of the FERC plan.  He said that the draft to be sent out from committee staff next week will be a staff draft and that it may not even address the tough issues like RTOs -- leaving those decisions to Members.  (I will check with Andy Black -- who told me a few weeks ago that it would either affirm FERC's authority or make RTOs mandatory.)

	5.	Burr would be very interested in meeting with Ken Lay (per the request letter we had faxed earlier yesterday).

Pickering is important for the added reason that he is the primary House sponsor of PUHCA repeal.  His staff confirmed many of the details about process in the House that we had heard elsewhere.  The staff draft will be out next week -- may not cover all issues yet.  There will be 2-3 hearings in September.  That will be followed by a Barton draft that would be formally introduced (reflecting additions and changes from the staff draft.)

	1.	On PUHCA -- I raised our concerns about the recordkeeping provisions and gave him the clarifying language from V&E included in our draft package of language we gave DOE.  He said he has spoken to Kelliher (whose advice he respects) and that Joe said the recordkeeping language needed to be clarified.  Joe referred him to the version in H.R. 2944 in the last Congress (which I will check to see if that solves our problem.)  Staffer is willing to look at our language.

	2.	On RTOs -- Pickering's office has not too much.  The staffer is under the impression that Entergy might actually like them in the way FERC has proposed.  He said Southern has raised concerns about FERC's plans with Pickering's office, but the staffer gets the impression that Southern thinks they are inevitable -- it is all a matter of timing.  The disturbing thing is the staffer said something about perhaps staging the RTO process so there would be more of them of smaller scope now on a pre-set path to 4-5 later.  I said this was a bad idea -- wasted resources to form the interm steps and likely that the final 4-5 would then never happen.  Instead, Congress needs to follow FERC's lead that 4-5 make sense based on natural trading markets, power flows, etc.

I was encouraged by these meetings in terms of not encountering stiff resistance -- but coming away knowing we need to fully implement our aggressive campaign plans to keep the legislative process from becoming a hindrance to achieving our RTO goals.",d..steffes@enron.com,"john --

Sure.  Confidentially, CSFB has the IPO.  Morgan Stanley is quietly handling 
some select acquisition inquiries.  I mentioned Enron and they didn't see why 
you'd want to look - so I offered to find out.  I think you'd be impressed by 
the CEO.

You can email me or call me at 310.201.4117.  I'm traveling Monday but always 
reachable.  Happy Turkey Day.

Per Mr. Steven Kean, of Enron Corp. please see below ( Appendix C - Order 8=
88=20
""Allegations of Public Utilities Exercising Transmission
Dominance).=20

                                                                 APPENDIX C


          Allegations of Public Utilities Exercising Transmission Dominance

          I.  Examples From Proceedings Before Administrative Law Judges

               These are examples of allegations that various public

          utilities have refused to provide comparable service, either

          through refusals to wheel, dilatory tactics that so protracted

          negotiations as to effectively deny wheeling, refusals to provide

          service priority equal to native load, or refusals to provide

          service flexibility equivalent to the utility's own use.

               A.  American Electric Power Service Corp. (AEP)

               In 1993, AEP filed, on behalf of its public utility

          associate companies, an open access tariff that offered only firm

          point-to-point service with very limited flexibility.  It did not

          offer network service, flexible point-to-point service, or non-

          firm service.  Thus, it did not provide customers with the same

          flexibility that AEP itself has.  Nor did it provide a service

          priority equivalent to that enjoyed by native load.  The

          Commission set AEP's tariff for hearing and, on rehearing, held

          that in order not to be unduly discriminatory, the tariff had to

          offer comparable service.  American Electric Power Service Corp.,

               At hearing, Raj Rao of Indiana Michigan Power Agency (IMPA)

          (Ex. IMPA-1, Feb 23, 1994) and Kenneth Hegemann of American

          Municipal Power-Ohio, Inc. (AMP-Ohio) (Ex. AMPO-1, Feb 23, 1994),

          both senior management officials, testified concerning AEP's
=0F,






                                        - 2 -


          alleged discriminatory practices. 1/  AMP-Ohio is an

          association of municipalities in Ohio, some of whose members

          depend on AEP for transmission and partial requirements service.=
=20

          IMPA is an association of municipalities in Indiana, and many of

          IMPA's loads are captive to the AEP transmission system.  The

          witnesses alleged as follows:=20

                    1.  In anticipation of high peak demands, AEP would

               contract for large blocks of available short-term power,

               withhold sale of short-term power, refuse to transmit third

               party short-term power, and require purchases from AEP at

               the emergency rate (100 mill/kwh) when an emergency might

               not exist.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 6.

                    2.  In December 1989, AMP-Ohio negotiated a 20 MW

               purchase of short-term power from Louisville Gas & Electric

               Company (LG&E).  AEP refused to wheel because LG&E had

               earlier that day told AEP it had no power to sell to AEP.=20

               AEP then bought the power from LG&E and offered to resell it

               to AMP-Ohio.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 6-7.

                    3.  In January 1990, AMP-Ohio solicited bids for

               February power purchases from a number of utilities

               including AEP.  AEP was not the winning bid.  AMP-Ohio made

               arrangements to purchase the power from four winning bidders

               and sought transmission through AEP.  When AMP-Ohio gave AEP
                             =20

          1/   After the Rehearing Order expanding the scope of the
               proceeding, AMP-Ohio and IMPA withdrew this testimony as no
               longer necessary.  This withdrawal does not change the fact
               that the testimony was sworn to under oath.
=0F,

               the schedule for delivery, AEP refused to transmit the

               power, matched the average price of the winning bids, and

               made the sale itself.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 7.

                    4.  In August 1993, an AMP-Ohio member (Columbus, Ohio)

               was purchasing 10 MW of hourly non-displacement power from

               AEP and, after AEP raised its price to 60 mills/kwh, sought

               another source for the next hour.  Consumers Power Company

               and Detroit Edison Company both offered non-displacement

               power at 40 mills.  AEP refused to transmit, saying it had a

               600 MW unit out and could not resell power from another

               source. 2/  Columbus cancelled the transaction and had to

               buy 10 MW of power from AEP at 100 mills/kwh.  Ex. AMPO-1 at

               7-8.

                    5.  In July 1993, two AMP-Ohio members (Columbus and

               St. Mary's) had been buying hourly non-displacement power

               from AEP when the price rose to 35 mills.  Dayton Power &

               Light Company (DP&L) offered to sell at 23 mills and AEP

               agreed to transmit for one hour.  But for the next hour, AEP

               said it had problems with its system, refused to transmit

               the power, kept the power from DP&L for itself and offered

               to sell power to AMP-Ohio for Columbus and St. Mary's at 100
                             =20

          2/   AEP generally limited its offer of short-term transmission
               to buy/sell transactions; that is, AEP would buy the power
               from the seller and resell it to the purchaser.=20
               Supplemental testimony of AEP Witness Baker (Ex. A-73) at
               27-29.  Often, the terms of the buy/sell transaction
               required transmission dependent utilities (TDUs) to maintain
               reserves and meet contractual commitments for at least a
               year.  Id.   =20

               mills.  Columbus increased its local generation, but St.

               Mary's purchased 8 MW at 100 mills.  For the next hour, AMP-

               Ohio arranged with DP&L for another 8 MW, hoping AEP would

               transmit under the 24 hour buy-sell agreement.  AEP did

               transmit this power.  Seven hours later in the day, St.

               Mary's Greenup Hydro project power was available and the 8

               MW from DP&L was no longer needed.  If St. Mary's had been

               receiving the hourly power that AEP had refused to transmit,

               St. Mary's could have switched to Greenup power.  But

               because AMP-Ohio had changed to daily service, St. Mary's

               had to pay a demand charge for the entire day, even though

               it used the power only 7 hours and would have paid less

               under the hourly rate.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 8-9.=20

                    6.  In January 1994, AMP-Ohio sought to transfer power

               from one member with generation to other members, which

               required transmission over AEP and Toledo Edison lines.=20

               Toledo Edison said yes, AEP said no.  AMP-Ohio's northern

               members purchased emergency power from Toledo Edison.  AMP-

               Ohio then reminded AEP that it had agreed not to deny

               transmission and AEP agreed to transmit.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 9. =
=20

                    7.  IMPA arranged to buy 80 MW of short-term power from

               LG&E and have it wheeled, using buy-sell arrangements,

               through Public Service Company of Indiana (PSI) and AEP to

               serve IMPA's load at Richmond (an IMPA member).  The

               delivered price was $.292 per kW-day plus a 1 mill adder.=20

               At the same time AEP arranged to buy 300 MW from PSI at $.30
=0F,






                                        - 5 -


               per kW day plus out-of-pocket energy costs.  Hence, PSI was

               shipping a total of 380 MW to AEP with 80 MW of that amount

               to be delivered to IMPA's load at Richmond.  Then, on a day

               when IMPA should have received the 80 MW, AEP told IMPA that

               PSI had sold everything to AEP and that IMPA would have to

               buy from AEP at $.63 per kW day plus the cost of energy from

               AEP.  IMPA purchased from AEP under protest.  AEP used its

               control over transmission to intercept the 80 MW at a lower

               price and resell it as short-term power to IMPA.  AEP

               claimed that PSI had terminated its sales to AEP on that

               day.  But the 80 MW was independent of PSI's other sales to

               AEP and would not have been interrupted if AEP had not

               interrupted it.  IMPA-1 at 7.

                    8.  IMPA has combustion turbines owned by and located

               at one member, which IMPA would like to connect to the Joint

               Transmission System owned by IMPA, CINergy and Wabash Valley

               Power Association.  To do so, IMPA needed a metering

               agreement with AEP, to which AEP would not agree.  IMPA-1 at

               6.

                    9.  In January 1994, IMPA had power to sell from its

               turbines when AEP and others needed power.  IMPA offered

               power to AEP but AEP it said could not purchase the power

               without an existing contract.  Moreover, since there was no

               short-term tariff, IMPA could not sell the power to another

               utility.  IMPA-1 at 6. =20

                    10.  Another example of the utility engaging in
=0F,






                                        - 6 -


               dilatory tactics that raised the customer's transaction

               costs and effectively denied transmission is the ""sham

               transaction"" provision proposed by AEP.  As filed, AEP's

               tariffs permitted it to deny service merely because a

               portion of the transmitted power might be used to serve a

               former retail customer of AEP.  See, e.g., Ex. BR&WVP-1 (J.

               Bertram Solomon testimony, February 23, 1994).  (As part of

               a settlement AEP filed the pro forma tariff and withdrew

               this provision.)=20

                    11.  Finally, AEP's originally filed tariff contained a

               ""prodigal customer"" provision.  Under this provision,

               transmission customers who sought to convert back to

               requirements service had to give AEP five years' notice, in

               which case AEP and the customer would enter into

               negotiations to determine whether AEP will provide service

               at all and if so under what rate, terms, and conditions.=20

               Ex. S-39 at 1 (Staff testimony).  AEP did not require notice

               from all new customers, only from prodigal customers.  Id.

               at 2.  That a potential customer was previously served by

               AEP is not a reason to treat the customer differently.  (AEP

               withdrew this provision when it filed the pro forma tariff.)

                    B.  Entergy Services, Inc. (Entergy)=20

               Entergy filed a partial settlement largely adopting the NOPR

          pro forma tariffs except for two provisions (headroom and

          ancillary services).  Because the settlement predated the filing

          date for customer testimony before the ALJ, the customers did not

                                        - 7 -


          address the need for Entergy to file a tariff.  However,

          customers did make allegations of discriminatory practices, as

          follows.    =20

                    1.  Customers alleged that Entergy flat-out refused to

               wheel.  Louisiana Energy and Power Authority (LEPA) witness

               Sylvan J. Richard testified that LEPA's predecessor systems

               could not obtain interconnections from Entergy.  Ex. SJR-1

               at 50.

                    2.  Customers also alleged that Entergy refused to

               provide service priority equal to native load and refused to

               provide service flexibility equivalent to the utility's own

               use.  For example, LEPA witness Richard testified that even

               after state commissions ordered interconnections and other

               coordination services, LEPA's predecessors were still not

               able to obtain coordination services because Entergy was not

               willing to coordinate and because the transmission service

               it did offer was inflexible, unidirectional point-to-point

               service, which prevented economic coordination with others.=
=20

               Id. at 50-51. =20

                    3.  South Mississippi Electric Power Association

               (SMEPA) witness J. Bertram Solomon testified that Entergy's

               original ""open access"" tariff was restricted to point-to-

               point service, proposed separate charges for each operating

               company, and required the cancellation of existing

               agreements in order to take service under the proposed

               tariff.  Ex. SMEPA-10 at 28.  Entergy eventually filed a
=0F,






                                        - 8 -


               network tariff, but proposed different local facilities

               charges for the various Entergy public utility operating

               subsidiaries.  Id. at 29.  Since these local facilities

               charges were higher than the transmission component of the

               subsidiaries' bundled rates, Entergy obtained a competitive

               advantage.  Id.

               group of cities and cooperatives that own or operate

               electric generation or distribution systems in Arkansas.=20

               ACC Witness Steven Merchant testified that Entergy has

               segregated the wholesale market between two of its

               subsidiaries, Arkansas Power & Light Copmpany (APL) and

               Entergy Power, Inc. (EPI).  Ex. SMM-1 at 16.  In marketing

               power and energy in Arkansas, EPI is subject to an Arkansas

               Commission order that bars EPI from competing with APL for

               wholesale loads without first obtaining a waiver.  Id.=20

               Recently, EPI requested this waiver for all wholesale

               transactions in Arkansas except for wholesale customers

               currently served by an Entergy subsidiary; in other words,

               EPI requested the Arkansas Commission to expand competition

               for all wholesale customers except where EPI might compete

               with APL.  Id.  ACC witness Merchant concluded that, since

               EPI does not compete with APL, Entergy insulates APL's

               wholesale business from competition and denies those

               wholesale customers access to EPI as a source of power,

               thereby limiting alternative generation sources available to

               Entergy has recently filed a joint motion with ACC to the

               Arkansas Commission seeking to extend the waiver and permit

               EPI to sell to APL's wholesale customers.  Ex. JFK-11 at 14-

               C.  Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E)

               Northern California Power Agency (NCPA) attached several

          documents to its 1988 complaint in Docket No. EL89-4.  These

          documents were provided to support NCPA's claim that PG&E's

          unreasonable practices under the PG&E/NCPA Interconnection

          Agreement (IA) effectively denied NCPA access to transmission

          properly requested under the IA.  Although the parties eventually

          settled and the Commission terminated the docket with a letter

          order dated May 18, 1988, these documents provide allegations of

          PG&E using dilatory tactics that so protracted negotiations as to

          effectively equal a refusal to wheel. 3/      =20

                    1.  PG&E stated that since transmission was not

               currently available, it was entitled to wait 72 months

               before providing transmission; that is, transmission access

               could not be granted before the passing of the 72-month

               notice period.  NCPA 1988 Complaint, Ex. 3.  However, the IA
                             =20

          3/   All of these incidents are related to and examples of PG&E's

               at 33,073 n.151), that is, the history of PG&E's attempt to
               avoid its commitments made to the California owners of the
               California Oregon Transmission Project (COTP).  However,
               these incidents are not exactly the same as the incidents
               described in the NOPR, because NCPA is not one of the owners
               of the COTP.

               provided that transmission be provided when it becomes

               actually available.  PG&E also requested substantial

               additional information, which NCPA considered beyond that

               reasonably necessary for a study, but still provided.  PG&E

               then determined that transmission was not available,

               reasoning that transmission was unavailable unless all the

               transmission requested could be provided 8760 hours per year

               without restrictions or limitations, extending through the

               expiration of the agreement in 2013.  NCPA 1988 Complaint at

               transmission at Midway.  NCPA 1988 Complaint, Ex. 5.  On

               January 28, 1988, PG&E filed an interconnection agreement

          England Power Company (NEP) witness Robert Bigelow's direct

          testimony expressed concern over the ""relatively restrictive

          transmission policies of both"" NU, on behalf of Northeast

          Utilities' public utility subsidiaries, and PSNH.  Bigelow Direct

          Testimony at 21 (filed May 25, 1990).  In his cross rebuttal

          testimony, Mr. Bigelow testified that ""NU has a poor track record

          abhorrent track record as a provider of transmission services.""=

          Mr. Bigelow described both NU's and NEP's (his own company)

          failure to provide service flexibility equivalent to their own

          use.  Except for NEP's TDUs, both NEP and NU historically

          provided only point-to-point transmission, which required

          separate scheduling for each transaction.  Bigelow Cross Rebuttal

          instances of Edison's conduct.  Richard Greenwalt was the power

          supply supervisor for the City of Riverside, California.  He was

          responsible for scheduling all purchases of energy for Riverside

          and for the cities of Azusa, Banning and Colton, California.=20

          supervisor for Anaheim.  He supervised Anaheim's load scheduling

          and is a former Edison employee, having worked for Edison for 20

          years.  McCann Testimony at 1-2 (November 1989).  These witnesses

          testified that Edison refused to wheel as follows.

                    1.  Edison's policy was to curtail the Cities any time

               it could be justified using any of a list of acceptable

               reasons to deny interruptible transmission service.  Id. at

               22-23.=20

                    2.  Edison would not generally provide transmission

               service when Edison could save money by itself purchasing

               the economy energy that would be wheeled.  McCann testimony

               at 19.  The Cities called Edison every hour to request

               interruptible transmission service.  Id..  Edison often

                                        - 13 -


               refused to sell energy available in the Western Systems

               Power Pool to the Cities and then made available higher cost

               contract energy or partial requirements service.  Id. at 19-

               20. =20

                    3.  When Anaheim requested Edison provide firm

               transmission of power from neighboring states, Edison would

               often agree to provide non-firm service but would not

               integrate the capacity for many years in the future, saying

               that its control area did not need capacity at that time.=20

               Hoyt testimony at 9.  Since the selling utility was

               interested in a sale of capacity, not just energy, the

               transaction would not occur.  Id.  Edison repeatedly used

               its control over transmission to deny Anaheim access to low-

               cost firm power.  Id. at 9-10. =20

                    4.  While Edison provided short-term firm transmission

               service to the Cities, it would only provide long-term firm

               service for three specific resources:  the SONGS nuclear

               plant, a specific IPP, and Hoover Dam power.  Hoyt testimony

               at 20.  One of Edison's reasons for denying long-term

               transmission was that Edison desired to reserve the

               transmission for its own future (unspecified) needs.  Id. =

                    8.  Riverside requested transmission from Palo Verde

               and was told that such service was not available.  Carnahan

               testimony at 16.  Edison offered Riverside only 12 MW of

               curtailable transmission entitlement to provide Riverside's

               share of Palo Verde.  Id.  This service was neither large

                    enough or long enough, and Edison insisted on

                    unreasonable terms and conditions.  Id.

                    9.  Azusa, Banning and Colton had a contract with

               Edison that entitled them to use their Palo Verde firm

               transmission path to schedule energy to meet their contract

               energy obligation.  Edison refused to permit the three

               cities to use that path.  Edison did not contest that the

               contracts allowed this use, but said that the scheduling of

               such small amounts of energy for the three cities would be

               too burdensome.  Greenwalt testimony at 14.=20

                    10.  Edison would not respond in a timely manner to the

               Cities' requests, routinely taking months to respond.  Drews

               testimony at 15.

                    11.  During the 1980s, Edison provided Colton with some

               transmission service to allow the Cities to reach certain

               suppliers, but limited the choices available to the Cities

               and imposed terms and conditions that increased the Cities'

               costs and placed Colton at a disadvantage against Edison.=20

               Drews testimony at 9.  Arranging alternative generation

               sources was difficult because the Cities always had to first

               get Edison to state whether it would provide transmission.=
=20

                    12.  During 1988 and 1989, a dispute arose between

               Edison and the Cities concerning the Hoover Uprating

               Project.  Drews testimony at 16.  Edison argued that for the

               months when units were out of service for uprating, and

               Southern Cities capacity was reduced to zero, Southern

               Cities would not receive an energy credit, even though

               energy was still available and used by Edison.  But the

               contracts allowed a participant who did not have capacity to

               still schedule its energy as non-firm energy on the capacity

               of another participant.  Id. at 16-17.

                    13.  In 1986, Azusa negotiated a power purchase

               contract with the California Department of Water Resources

               in increments of first 5 MW and then 2 MW (for a total of 7

               MW).  Hsu testimony at 14.  First Edison assured Azusa that

               the transmission for the additional 2 MW would not be a

               problem.  Id.  Then Edison would not agree to amend the

               transmission service agreement for the additional 2 MW.  Id.
=0F,

                    14.  In 1986, Azusa notified Edison of Special

               Condition 12 4/ purchases from PG&E and requested firm

               transmission service.  Id.  Two months before service was to

               begin, Edison notified the Cities of a problem with the

               transmission lines.  Id.  Transmission was eventually

               granted, but only after a four-month delay and substantial

               losses to the Cities.  Id.  Then Edison decided there was no

               problem with its transmission facilities.  Id. at 14-15.

                    15.  In 1986-87, the Cities purchased 20 MW from PG&E

               and 80 MW from Deseret G&T Cooperative.  Hoyt testimony at

               7-8.  Edison stated that without reinforcement of its

               transmission system, Edison would not provide the

               transmission.  Id.  There was a five-month delay during

               which the Cities were forced to purchase from Edison at a

               higher cost.  Id. at 8-9.  Then Edison decided that the

               transmission system did not need reinforcement.  Id. at 8.

                    16.  Edison also refused to provide a service priority

               equal to that of native load.  It would curtail the Cities

               in order to purchase more economy energy for itself.  McCann

               testimony at 28.  If Edison could make the purchase, it

               would curtail the City and use the energy for itself.  Id.=

               Special Condition 12 resources and allowed the Cities to

               restrictions.=20

               Edison.  Id. at 24.

                    17.  According to Edison, the interruptible

               transmission it provided the Cities was interruptible for

               any reason.  Id. at 20.  A purchase could be terminated the

               hour after it is begun or even during the hour.  Id.  As a

               result, the Cities lost opportunities to make advantageous

               economy purchases.  Id. at 20-21. =20

                    18.  Edison also refused to provide customers

               flexibility similar to the flexibility Edison provided

               itself.  Edison's refusal to provide bi-directional

               transmission service restricted the Cities' abilities to

               purchase hydroelectric energy from the Pacific Northwest.=20

               Hoyt testimony at 22.  Because most contracts with Northwest

               utilities require a return of power, the Northwest utilities

               would not deal with the Cities without transmission to

               return energy.  Id. at 22-23.  Edison did provide bi-

               directional transmission to the Los Angeles Department of

               Water & Power (LADWP) to accommodate flows to and from

               Arizona.  Id.

                    19.  Riverside was unable to obtain non-firm service

               more than two hours in advance of need.  Carnahan testimony

                    20.  Riverside and Colton were both served out of

               energy to each other.  Greenwalt testimony at 17.=20

                    21.  Riverside's agreement with Edison allowed

               Riverside to purchase a block of energy through the WSPP and

               divide it up among the four Cities (Azusa, Banning, Colton

               and Riverside).  Greenwalt testimony at 17.  When Riverside

               had excess energy from other sources, Edison would not

               permit it to sell that energy to the other three cities.=20

               Id.  For example, Riverside attempted to sell Deseret energy

               transmitted by LADWP to the Edison system.  Id. at 17-18.=20

               LADWP would not break out the Cities' shares of that energy,

               and Edison would not accept the energy as a delivery for all

               four cities.  Id. at 18.  Edison argued that because this

               energy was excess energy that Riverside could not use,

               Riverside did not have transmission rights to bring it into

               the control area.  Id.  As a result, Riverside paid for the

               energy delivered by LADWP to the Edison control area, but

               could not sell it to the other three cities, and gave it to

               Edison itself, which consumed the energy without making any

               payment for it.  Id.  Riverside tried a number of

               alternative paths, including using WSPP transmission where

               Riverside paid Edison 5 mills to connect to Azusa, 5 mills

               to connect to Banning, and 5 mills to connect to Colton for

               each megawatthour.  While this approach was successful for a

               while, eventually Edison refused to permit these sales. =20

                    22.  Edison claimed that the Cities only have

               transmission rights to bring in enough Special Condition 12

               energy to satisfy the Cities' load.  Greenwalt testimony at

               18. =20

                    23.  Edison contended that the Cities' load

               requirements were satisfied first by integrated resources

               and then by Special Condition 12 and economy energy

               purchases.  Id. at 19.  When the Cities' integrated

               resources exceeded their load, any Special Condition 12

               resources became excess.  Under Riverside's Deseret

               contract, the Cities were required to take a minimum of 35

               MW each hour.  Id.  Edison acknowledged that it was

               obligated to buy, or allow the Cities to sell, any excess

               energy from Riverside's integrated resources.  Id.  However,

               Edison refused to give the Cities credit for excess Special

               Condition 12 energy brought into the area, claiming that the

               Cities could not have brought it in because they did not

               have transmission rights.  Id. =20

          II.  Other Examples of Transmission Disputes

               Disputes over transmission are not uncommon, contrary to

          EEI's suggestion.  Some recent examples taken from pleadings and

          other documents and from Commission orders reveal that it has

          been very difficult for various entities in the electric power

          industry to agree on transmission rights.  These examples also

          reveal that even after issuance of AEP and the Open Access NOPR

          with its proposed pro forma tariffs, there has been considerable

          controversy over whether various utilities' ""open access"" tariffs

          deviate from those tariffs.  (The Commission has allowed

          utilities that adopt tariffs that match or exceed the non-rate

          terms and conditions in the NOPR pro forma tariffs to obtain

          certain benefits.)

                    A.  In a letter of February 3, 1995 to Mr. Gerald

               Richman of the Commission's Enforcement section in the

               Office of the General Counsel, Steven J. Kean, Vice

               President, Regulatory Affairs, Enron Power Marketing, Inc.

               (Enron) alleged that Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (NiMo)

               refused to wheel power from Rochester Gas & Electric (RG&E)

               to Enron under RG&E's transmission contract with NiMo;

               however, when Enron revealed the buyer, NiMo did wheel power

               for RG&E to the buyer.  Mr. Kean alleged that this was not

               an isolated incident.  NiMo argued that the contract did not

               require it to provide RG&E with transmission to Enron.  It

               also said that the principle of comparability does not

               require the service.  Letter of November 21, 1994 from NiMo

               representative A. Karen Hill to Gerald Richman.

                    B.  The Commission's Task Force Hot Line (Hot

               Line) received a complaint that a member of the New

               York Power Pool (NYPP) refused to transmit power that

               another member bought from a power marketer.  In a

               letter of November 17, 1994, from Chair Moler to Mr.

               William J. Balet, Executive Director of NYPP, Chair

               Moler explained that the Commission's enforcement staff

               had investigated and found the allegation to be true.

                    C.  In Southern Minnesota Municipal Power Agency

               v. Northern States Power Company (Minnesota), 73 FERC =0F4

               61,350 (1995), NSP and SMMPA had a contract under which

               NSP agreed to provide transmission service.  However,

               the parties had numerous disputes over the service.=20

               The Commission found that NSP had misinterpreted the

               contract in several ways.  For, example, SMMPA argued

               that it should be able to directly schedule its

               deliveries of energy out of the NSP control area and

               that it should not be limited to particular points of

               delivery.  NSP argued that only it was entitled to

               control the physical operation of scheduling.  The

               Commission found that the clear language of the

               contracts gave SMMPA the authority to schedule its own

               power. =20

                    D.  Mid-Continent Area Power Pool, 72 FERC =0F4 61,223

               (1995), involved MAPP's membership criteria, which made it

               impossible for a power marketer to join MAPP and obtain the

               benefits of certain transmission services available only to

               MAPP members.  The Commission found that the membership

               criteria may be unreasonable, particularly since there may

               be less burdensome ways of setting up membership criteria

               for non-traditional entities.

          allegations of public utilities exercising transmission dominance

          i.  examples from proceedings before administrative law judges

               these are examples of allegations that various public

          utilities have refused to provide comparable service, either

          through refusals to wheel, dilatory tactics that so protracted

          negotiations as to effectively deny wheeling, refusals to provide

          service priority equal to native load, or refusals to provide

          service flexibility equivalent to the utility's own use.

               a.  american electric power service corp. (aep)

               in 1993, aep filed, on behalf of its public utility

          associate companies, an open access tariff that offered only firm

          point-to-point service with very limited flexibility.  it did not

          offer network service, flexible point-to-point service, or non-

          firm service.  thus, it did not provide customers with the same

          flexibility that aep itself has.  nor did it provide a service

          priority equivalent to that enjoyed by native load.  the

          commission set aep's tariff for hearing and, on rehearing, held

          that in order not to be unduly discriminatory, the tariff had to

          offer comparable service.  american electric power service corp.,

          alleged discriminatory practices. 1/  amp-ohio is an

          association of municipalities in ohio, some of whose members

          depend on aep for transmission and partial requirements service.=
=20

          impa is an association of municipalities in indiana, and many of

          impa's loads are captive to the aep transmission system.  the

          witnesses alleged as follows:=20

                    1.  in anticipation of high peak demands, aep would

               contract for large blocks of available short-term power,

               withhold sale of short-term power, refuse to transmit third

               party short-term power, and require purchases from aep at

               the emergency rate (100 mill/kwh) when an emergency might

               not exist.  ex. ampo-1 at 6.

                    2.  in december 1989, amp-ohio negotiated a 20 mw

               purchase of short-term power from louisville gas & electric

               company (lg&e).  aep refused to wheel because lg&e had

               earlier that day told aep it had no power to sell to aep.=20

               aep then bought the power from lg&e and offered to resell it

               to amp-ohio.  ex. ampo-1 at 6-7.

                    3.  in january 1990, amp-ohio solicited bids for

               february power purchases from a number of utilities

               including aep.  aep was not the winning bid.  amp-ohio made

               arrangements to purchase the power from four winning bidders

               and sought transmission through aep.  when amp-ohio gave aep
                             =20

          1/   after the rehearing order expanding the scope of the
               proceeding, amp-ohio and impa withdrew this testimony as no
               longer necessary.  this withdrawal does not change the fact
               that the testimony was sworn to under oath.

               the schedule for delivery, aep refused to transmit the

               power, matched the average price of the winning bids, and

               made the sale itself.  ex. ampo-1 at 7.

                    4.  in august 1993, an amp-ohio member (columbus, ohio)

               was purchasing 10 mw of hourly non-displacement power from

               aep and, after aep raised its price to 60 mills/kwh, sought

               another source for the next hour.  consumers power company

               and detroit edison company both offered non-displacement

               power at 40 mills.  aep refused to transmit, saying it had a

               600 mw unit out and could not resell power from another

               source. 2/  columbus cancelled the transaction and had to

               buy 10 mw of power from aep at 100 mills/kwh.  ex. ampo-1 at

               7-8.

                    5.  in july 1993, two amp-ohio members (columbus and

               st. mary's) had been buying hourly non-displacement power

               from aep when the price rose to 35 mills.  dayton power &

               light company (dp&l) offered to sell at 23 mills and aep

               agreed to transmit for one hour.  but for the next hour, aep

               said it had problems with its system, refused to transmit

               the power, kept the power from dp&l for itself and offered

               to sell power to amp-ohio for columbus and st. mary's at 100
                             =20

          2/   aep generally limited its offer of short-term transmission
               to buy/sell transactions; that is, aep would buy the power
               from the seller and resell it to the purchaser.=20
               supplemental testimony of aep witness baker (ex. a-73) at
               27-29.  often, the terms of the buy/sell transaction
               required transmission dependent utilities (tdus) to maintain
               reserves and meet contractual commitments for at least a
               year.  id.   =20

               mills.  columbus increased its local generation, but st.

               mary's purchased 8 mw at 100 mills.  for the next hour, amp-

               ohio arranged with dp&l for another 8 mw, hoping aep would

               transmit under the 24 hour buy-sell agreement.  aep did

               transmit this power.  seven hours later in the day, st.

               mary's greenup hydro project power was available and the 8

               mw from dp&l was no longer needed.  if st. mary's had been

               receiving the hourly power that aep had refused to transmit,

               st. mary's could have switched to greenup power.  but

               because amp-ohio had changed to daily service, st. mary's

               had to pay a demand charge for the entire day, even though

               it used the power only 7 hours and would have paid less

               under the hourly rate.  ex. ampo-1 at 8-9.=20

                    6.  in january 1994, amp-ohio sought to transfer power

               from one member with generation to other members, which

               required transmission over aep and toledo edison lines.=20

               toledo edison said yes, aep said no.  amp-ohio's northern

               members purchased emergency power from toledo edison.  amp-

               ohio then reminded aep that it had agreed not to deny

               transmission and aep agreed to transmit.  ex. ampo-1 at 9. =
=20

                    7.  impa arranged to buy 80 mw of short-term power from

               lg&e and have it wheeled, using buy-sell arrangements,

               through public service company of indiana (psi) and aep to

               serve impa's load at richmond (an impa member).  the

               delivered price was $.292 per kw-day plus a 1 mill adder.=20

               at the same time aep arranged to buy 300 mw from psi at $.30
=0f,






                                        - 5 -


               per kw day plus out-of-pocket energy costs.  hence, psi was

               shipping a total of 380 mw to aep with 80 mw of that amount

               to be delivered to impa's load at richmond.  then, on a day

               when impa should have received the 80 mw, aep told impa that

               psi had sold everything to aep and that impa would have to

               buy from aep at $.63 per kw day plus the cost of energy from

               aep.  impa purchased from aep under protest.  aep used its

               control over transmission to intercept the 80 mw at a lower

               price and resell it as short-term power to impa.  aep

               claimed that psi had terminated its sales to aep on that

               day.  but the 80 mw was independent of psi's other sales to

               aep and would not have been interrupted if aep had not

               interrupted it.  impa-1 at 7.

                    8.  impa has combustion turbines owned by and located

               at one member, which impa would like to connect to the joint

               transmission system owned by impa, cinergy and wabash valley

               power association.  to do so, impa needed a metering

               agreement with aep, to which aep would not agree.  impa-1 at

               6.

                    9.  in january 1994, impa had power to sell from its

               turbines when aep and others needed power.  impa offered

               power to aep but aep it said could not purchase the power

               without an existing contract.  moreover, since there was no

               short-term tariff, impa could not sell the power to another

               utility.  impa-1 at 6. =20

               dilatory tactics that raised the customer's transaction

               costs and effectively denied transmission is the ""sham

               transaction"" provision proposed by aep.  as filed, aep's

               tariffs permitted it to deny service merely because a

               portion of the transmitted power might be used to serve a

               former retail customer of aep.  see, e.g., ex. br&wvp-1 (j.

               bertram solomon testimony, february 23, 1994).  (as part of

               a settlement aep filed the pro forma tariff and withdrew

               this provision.)=20

                    11.  finally, aep's originally filed tariff contained a

               ""prodigal customer"" provision.  under this provision,

               transmission customers who sought to convert back to

               requirements service had to give aep five years' notice, in

               which case aep and the customer would enter into

               negotiations to determine whether aep will provide service

               at all and if so under what rate, terms, and conditions.=20

               ex. s-39 at 1 (staff testimony).  aep did not require notice

               from all new customers, only from prodigal customers.  id.

               at 2.  that a potential customer was previously served by

               aep is not a reason to treat the customer differently.  (aep

               withdrew this provision when it filed the pro forma tariff.)

                    b.  entergy services, inc. (entergy)=20

               entergy filed a partial settlement largely adopting the nopr

          pro forma tariffs except for two provisions (headroom and

          address the need for entergy to file a tariff.  however,

          customers did make allegations of discriminatory practices, as

          follows.    =20

                    1.  customers alleged that entergy flat-out refused to

               wheel.  louisiana energy and power authority (lepa) witness

               sylvan j. richard testified that lepa's predecessor systems

               could not obtain interconnections from entergy.  ex. sjr-1

               at 50.

                    2.  customers also alleged that entergy refused to

               provide service priority equal to native load and refused to

               provide service flexibility equivalent to the utility's own

               use.  for example, lepa witness richard testified that even

               after state commissions ordered interconnections and other

               coordination services, lepa's predecessors were still not

               able to obtain coordination services because entergy was not

               willing to coordinate and because the transmission service

               it did offer was inflexible, unidirectional point-to-point

               service, which prevented economic coordination with others.=

                    3.  south mississippi electric power association

               (smepa) witness j. bertram solomon testified that entergy's

               original ""open access"" tariff was restricted to point-to-

               point service, proposed separate charges for each operating

               company, and required the cancellation of existing

               agreements in order to take service under the proposed

               tariff.  ex. smepa-10 at 28.  entergy eventually filed a

               network tariff, but proposed different local facilities

               charges for the various entergy public utility operating

               subsidiaries.  id. at 29.  since these local facilities

               charges were higher than the transmission component of the

               subsidiaries' bundled rates, entergy obtained a competitive

               advantage.  id.

               group of cities and cooperatives that own or operate

               electric generation or distribution systems in arkansas.=20

               acc witness steven merchant testified that entergy has

               segregated the wholesale market between two of its

               subsidiaries, arkansas power & light copmpany (apl) and

               entergy power, inc. (epi).  ex. smm-1 at 16.  in marketing

               power and energy in arkansas, epi is subject to an arkansas

               commission order that bars epi from competing with apl for

               wholesale loads without first obtaining a waiver.  id.=20

               recently, epi requested this waiver for all wholesale

               transactions in arkansas except for wholesale customers

               currently served by an entergy subsidiary; in other words,

               epi requested the arkansas commission to expand competition

               for all wholesale customers except where epi might compete

               with apl.  id.  acc witness merchant concluded that, since

               epi does not compete with apl, entergy insulates apl's

               wholesale business from competition and denies those

               wholesale customers access to epi as a source of power,

               thereby limiting alternative generation sources available to

               c.  pacific gas & electric company (pg&e)

               northern california power agency (ncpa) attached several

          documents to its 1988 complaint in docket no. el89-4.  these

          documents were provided to support ncpa's claim that pg&e's

          unreasonable practices under the pg&e/ncpa interconnection

          agreement (ia) effectively denied ncpa access to transmission

          properly requested under the ia.  although the parties eventually

          settled and the commission terminated the docket with a letter

          order dated may 18, 1988, these documents provide allegations of

          pg&e using dilatory tactics that so protracted negotiations as to

          effectively equal a refusal to wheel. 3/      =20

                    1.  pg&e stated that since transmission was not

               currently available, it was entitled to wait 72 months

               before providing transmission; that is, transmission access

               could not be granted before the passing of the 72-month

               notice period.  ncpa 1988 complaint, ex. 3.  however, the ia

          3/   all of these incidents are related to and examples of pg&e's

               california oregon transmission project (cotp).  however,
               these incidents are not exactly the same as the incidents
               described in the nopr, because ncpa is not one of the owners
               of the cotp.

               provided that transmission be provided when it becomes

               actually available.  pg&e also requested substantial

               additional information, which ncpa considered beyond that

               reasonably necessary for a study, but still provided.  pg&e

               then determined that transmission was not available,

               reasoning that transmission was unavailable unless all the

               transmission requested could be provided 8760 hours per year

               without restrictions or limitations, extending through the

               expiration of the agreement in 2013.  ncpa 1988 complaint at

          years.  mccann testimony at 1-2 (november 1989).  these witnesses

          testified that edison refused to wheel as follows.

                    1.  edison's policy was to curtail the cities any time

               it could be justified using any of a list of acceptable

               refused to sell energy available in the western systems

               20. =20

                    3.  when anaheim requested edison provide firm

               transmission of power from neighboring states, edison would

               often agree to provide non-firm service but would not

               integrate the capacity for many years in the future, saying

               that its control area did not need capacity at that time.=20

               hoyt testimony at 9.  since the selling utility was

               interested in a sale of capacity, not just energy, the

               transaction would not occur.  id.  edison repeatedly used

               its control over transmission to deny anaheim access to low-

               cost firm power.  id. at 9-10. =20

                    4.  while edison provided short-term firm transmission

               service to the cities, it would only provide long-term firm

               service for three specific resources:  the songs nuclear

               plant, a specific ipp, and hoover dam power.  hoyt testimony

               at 20.  one of edison's reasons for denying long-term

               transmission was that edison desired to reserve the

               testimony at 16.  edison offered riverside only 12 mw of

                    unreasonable terms and conditions.  id.

                    9.  azusa, banning and colton had a contract with

               edison that entitled them to use their palo verde firm

               transmission path to schedule energy to meet their contract

               energy obligation.  edison refused to permit the three

               cities to use that path.  edison did not contest that the

               contracts allowed this use, but said that the scheduling of

               such small amounts of energy for the three cities would be

               testimony at 15.

                    11.  during the 1980s, edison provided colton with some

               transmission service to allow the cities to reach certain

               suppliers, but limited the choices available to the cities

               and imposed terms and conditions that increased the cities'

               costs and placed colton at a disadvantage against edison.=20

               drews testimony at 9.  arranging alternative generation

               sources was difficult because the cities always had to first

               get edison to state whether it would provide transmission.=
=20

                    12.  during 1988 and 1989, a dispute arose between

               edison and the cities concerning the hoover uprating

               project.  drews testimony at 16.  edison argued that for the

               months when units were out of service for uprating, and

               southern cities capacity was reduced to zero, southern

               cities would not receive an energy credit, even though

               energy was still available and used by edison.  but the

               contracts allowed a participant who did not have capacity to

               still schedule its energy as non-firm energy on the capacity

               of another participant.  id. at 16-17.

                    13.  in 1986, azusa negotiated a power purchase

               contract with the california department of water resources

               in increments of first 5 mw and then 2 mw (for a total of 7

               mw).  hsu testimony at 14.  first edison assured azusa that

               the transmission for the additional 2 mw would not be a

               problem.  id.  then edison would not agree to amend the

               transmission service agreement for the additional 2 mw.  id.

                    14.  in 1986, azusa notified edison of special

               condition 12 4/ purchases from pg&e and requested firm

               transmission service.  id.  two months before service was to

               begin, edison notified the cities of a problem with the

               transmission lines.  id.  transmission was eventually

               granted, but only after a four-month delay and substantial

               losses to the cities.  id.  then edison decided there was no

               problem with its transmission facilities.  id. at 14-15.

                    15.  in 1986-87, the cities purchased 20 mw from pg&e

               and 80 mw from deseret g&t cooperative.  hoyt testimony at

               7-8.  edison stated that without reinforcement of its

               transmission system, edison would not provide the

               transmission.  id.  there was a five-month delay during

               which the cities were forced to purchase from edison at a

               higher cost.  id. at 8-9.  then edison decided that the

               transmission system did not need reinforcement.  id. at 8.

                    16.  edison also refused to provide a service priority

               equal to that of native load.  it would curtail the cities

               in order to purchase more economy energy for itself.  mccann

               would curtail the city and use the energy for itself.  id.=

               when edison curtailed the cities, they were not able to

                             =20

          4/   special condition 12 of the integrated operations agreement
               between edison and the southern cities defined certain
               special condition 12 resources and allowed the cities to
               make certain uses of those resources, subject to certain
               restrictions.=20

               purchase economy energy and instead purchased energy from

               edison.  id. at 24.

                    17.  according to edison, the interruptible

               transmission it provided the cities was interruptible for

               any reason.  id. at 20.  a purchase could be terminated the

               hour after it is begun or even during the hour.  id.  as a

               result, the cities lost opportunities to make advantageous

               economy purchases.  id. at 20-21. =20

                    18.  edison also refused to provide customers

               flexibility similar to the flexibility edison provided

               itself.  edison's refusal to provide bi-directional

               transmission service restricted the cities' abilities to

               purchase hydroelectric energy from the pacific northwest.=20

               hoyt testimony at 22.  because most contracts with northwest

               utilities require a return of power, the northwest utilities

               would not deal with the cities without transmission to

               return energy.  id. at 22-23.  edison did provide bi-

               directional transmission to the los angeles department of

               water & power (ladwp) to accommodate flows to and from

               arizona.  id.

                    19.  riverside was unable to obtain non-firm service

               more than two hours in advance of need.  carnahan testimony

               at 18.

                    20.  riverside and colton were both served out of

               edison's vista substation.  although the two cities were on

               the same 69 kv bus, edison would not allow them to sell

               energy to each other.  greenwalt testimony at 17.=20

                    21.  riverside's agreement with edison allowed

               riverside to purchase a block of energy through the wspp and

               divide it up among the four cities (azusa, banning, colton

               and riverside).  greenwalt testimony at 17.  when riverside

               had excess energy from other sources, edison would not

               permit it to sell that energy to the other three cities.=20

               id.  for example, riverside attempted to sell deseret energy

               transmitted by ladwp to the edison system.  id. at 17-18.=20

               ladwp would not break out the cities' shares of that energy,

               and edison would not accept the energy as a delivery for all

               four cities.  id. at 18.  edison argued that because this

               energy was excess energy that riverside could not use,

               riverside did not have transmission rights to bring it into

               the control area.  id.  as a result, riverside paid for the

               energy delivered by ladwp to the edison control area, but

               could not sell it to the other three cities, and gave it to

               edison itself, which consumed the energy without making any

               payment for it.  id.  riverside tried a number of

               alternative paths, including using wspp transmission where

               riverside paid edison 5 mills to connect to azusa, 5 mills

               to connect to banning, and 5 mills to connect to colton for

               each megawatthour.  while this approach was successful for a

               while, eventually edison refused to permit these sales. =20

                    22.  edison claimed that the cities only have

               transmission rights to bring in enough special condition 12
=0f,






                                        - 19 -


               energy to satisfy the cities' load.  greenwalt testimony at

               18. =20

                    23.  edison contended that the cities' load

               requirements were satisfied first by integrated resources

               and then by special condition 12 and economy energy

               purchases.  id. at 19.  when the cities' integrated

               resources exceeded their load, any special condition 12

               resources became excess.  under riverside's deseret

               contract, the cities were required to take a minimum of 35

               mw each hour.  id.  edison acknowledged that it was

               obligated to buy, or allow the cities to sell, any excess

               energy from riverside's integrated resources.  id.  however,

               edison refused to give the cities credit for excess special

               condition 12 energy brought into the area, claiming that the

               cities could not have brought it in because they did not

               have transmission rights.  id. =20

          ii.  other examples of transmission disputes

               disputes over transmission are not uncommon, contrary to

          eei's suggestion.  some recent examples taken from pleadings and

          other documents and from commission orders reveal that it has

          been very difficult for various entities in the electric power

          industry to agree on transmission rights.  these examples also

          reveal that even after issuance of aep and the open access nopr

          with its proposed pro forma tariffs, there has been considerable

          controversy over whether various utilities' ""open access"" tariffs

          deviate from those tariffs.  (the commission has allowed
=0f,






                                        - 20 -


          utilities that adopt tariffs that match or exceed the non-rate

          terms and conditions in the nopr pro forma tariffs to obtain

          certain benefits.)

                    a.  in a letter of february 3, 1995 to mr. gerald

               richman of the commission's enforcement section in the

               office of the general counsel, steven j. kean, vice

               president, regulatory affairs, enron power marketing, inc.

               (enron) alleged that niagara mohawk power corporation (nimo)

               refused to wheel power from rochester gas & electric (rg&e)

               to enron under rg&e's transmission contract with nimo;

               however, when enron revealed the buyer, nimo did wheel power

               for rg&e to the buyer.  mr. kean alleged that this was not

               an isolated incident.  nimo argued that the contract did not

               require it to provide rg&e with transmission to enron.  it

               also said that the principle of comparability does not

               require the service.  letter of november 21, 1994 from nimo

               representative a. karen hill to gerald richman.

                    b.  the commission's task force hot line (hot

               line) received a complaint that a member of the new

               york power pool (nypp) refused to transmit power that

               another member bought from a power marketer.  in a

               letter of november 17, 1994, from chair moler to mr.

               william j. balet, executive director of nypp, chair

               moler explained that the commission's enforcement staff

               had investigated and found the allegation to be true.

                    c.  in southern minnesota municipal power agency

               v. northern states power company (minnesota), 73 ferc =0f4

               61,350 (1995), nsp and smmpa had a contract under which

               nsp agreed to provide transmission service.  however,

               the parties had numerous disputes over the service.=20

               the commission found that nsp had misinterpreted the

               contract in several ways.  for, example, smmpa argued

               that it should be able to directly schedule its

               deliveries of energy out of the nsp control area and

               that it should not be limited to particular points of

               delivery.  nsp argued that only it was entitled to

               control the physical operation of scheduling.  the

               commission found that the clear language of the

               contracts gave smmpa the authority to schedule its own

               power. =20

                    d.  mid-continent area power pool, 72 ferc =0f4 61,223

               (1995), involved mapp's membership criteria, which made it

               impossible for a power marketer to join mapp and obtain the

               benefits of certain transmission services available only to

               mapp members.  the commission found that the membership

               criteria may be unreasonable, particularly since there may

               be less burdensome ways of setting up membership criteria

               for non-traditional entities.

Vince,

Margaret mentioned to me that you might be able to help me with the 
followings:

We (Central European Origination, London office) might start talking to two 
aluminium companies in Central Europe.  Before we were to meet them, it would 
be rather useful (I suppose) to find out what aluminium deals (if any) you 
closed in the States.  The most important issue would be whether you managed 
to index the price of power to the price of aluminium; if yes, how.

Your help would be much appreacited.

Many thanks,

I did two gas deals with Oxy Vinyls LP, and repeated a Keep Ready Agreement
with Occidental Chemical.


For the gas deals, we can use the same special purpose GTC that we used
last year (it is unique to Oxy).  Here are the deals:

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-39crfm.doc
5,000 MMBtu per day
Battleground Road plant HPL meter # 1485
Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index minus $0.0075
July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-39acrfm.doc
5,000 MMBtu per day
La Porte plant HPL meter # 1444
Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index minus $0.0075
July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002


For the Keep Ready Agreement, everything is the same as last year .....

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-47ltr.doc
Term June 1, 2001 to May 31, 2002
One change ... at the end of Section 4, need to delete the last 5 words ""OR
THE BILL OF SALE"" .... we had come up with this agreement by adapting
another one, and had to manually strike these words because they are not
relevant.


Thanks

Lee

If you can't find someone to pull these, let me know and I'll come down and get them.

Also, Livelink doesn't show a power master with Coral Power LLC, but I have someone checking on this.

		 Subject: Steel Stradegies Conference - NYC 06/20/01

Yesterday, during the Panel V discussion, ""Why Have Steel Middlemen Gone From 
The Most Threatened To Best Positioned"", we got some direct feedback on the 
perception of Enron in the marketplace. The participants were, Fred Lamesh 
CEO of Trademarked Inc., Michael Siegel, CEO of Olympic Steel, Bud Siegel, 
CEO of Russell Metals, and Wilfred von Bulow, CEO of Ferrostaal Inc.; the 
moderator was Peter Marcus, Managing Partners of World Steel Dynamics. Each 
participant gave a brief speech about their respective companies which was 
followed by a Q&A session. The first mention of Enron was during Michael 
Siegal's speech in which he mentioned that Olympic Steel had ""sold material 
to Enron"" and that ""Enron has recognized that steel is a commodity and for 
many countries represents currency.""  Michael was clearly proud of his 
transactions with Enron and agreed with our view of steel as a commodity.
The real feedback came during the Q&A. Peter Marcus posted the following 
question to the panelists. ""What about Enron? With their plan of entering the 
market with a number of hubs across the country, stocking material, with 
large scale distribution on a ""spot"" basis. Will this business model work? Do 
they offer any real value or not?"" 
Following are the respective responses as best I can reiterate from my notes 
( please don't quote me on this):
Fred Lamesh, TradeArbed: ""The concept is too new to make a judgment yet on 
credibility. Enron has certainly been successful in the past and should not 
be discounted. I question their ability to procure material at competitive 
enough levels to make this a profitable venture but there may be some value 
in their delivery of financial instruments.""
Michael Siegal, Olympic Steel: ""Enron certainly has the financial means to 
withstand a ""break even"" business to support their financial instruments. At 
this point, we view them as just another entity in the market and until we 
can evaluate their performance, it is difficult to determine value. I am 
concerned though that they will prop up under capitalized distributors and 
allow them to operate despite mismanagement. One interesting and unique 
concept that they are trying to bring to the industry though is the idea that 
a contract is a contract, with liquidated damages for non performance. That 
would certainly be change (sporadic laughter among the crowd).""
Bud Siegel, Russell Metals: ""I addressed the Enron question last night during 
dinner and was told that I was abusive to the young lady from Enron (Tammy, I 
later understood that you had a less than cordial conversation with Bud the 
previous evening). I am calling Enron the ""Hunts of the steel business"" with 
their idea of buying up the market. The whole concept is like Swiss cheese. 
You can not put up depots, buy from steel mills, and expect to sell the same 
steel to distributors cheaper than the mills themselves. The logistical 
expenses alone guarantee failure. You can not be everything to everyone. 
Considering the current state of under financing in this industry, they will 
inevitably end up financing bankrupt people and take credit hits. Without 
immediate success, Enron has been known to exist markets quickly in the past, 
and I believe they will be gone within the year.""(some sporadic applause)   
Wilfried von Bulow, Ferrostaal: ""Right now they are just another additional 
player in the market. They will certainly have an impact but it would not be 
pragmatic to make a judgment yet on their ability to succeed. Let's watch it 
and see if there is any value to what they are trying to bring to the market.""
It appears to me that the focus on Enron in the market right now continues to 
be more on the physical aspects of what we are doing and not enough emphasis 
or credibility is being given to the financial tools we are bringing. It is 
obviously very easy to poke holes in a concept of trading large volumes of 
physical steel on a ""spot"" basis through the set up of physical hubs around 
the country. In the end, the only way we will be successful will be by 
bringing liquidity to our index through financial instruments. We need to 
focus more on educating customers about our financial tools, developing our 
curve, and bringing players to the market.

question to the panelists. ""what about enron? with their plan of entering the 
market with a number of hubs across the country, stocking material, with 
large scale distribution on a ""spot"" basis. will this business model work? do 
they offer any real value or not?"" 
following are the respective responses as best i can reiterate from my notes 
( please don't quote me on this):
fred lamesh, tradearbed: ""the concept is too new to make a judgment yet on 
credibility. enron has certainly been successful in the past and should not 
be discounted. i question their ability to procure material at competitive 
enough levels to make this a profitable venture but there may be some value 
in their delivery of financial instruments.""
michael siegal, olympic steel: ""enron certainly has the financial means to 
withstand a ""break even"" business to support their financial instruments. at 
this point, we view them as just another entity in the market and until we 
can evaluate their performance, it is difficult to determine value. i am 
concerned though that they will prop up under capitalized distributors and 
allow them to operate despite mismanagement. one interesting and unique 
concept that they are trying to bring to the industry though is the idea that 
a contract is a contract, with liquidated damages for non performance. that 
would certainly be change (sporadic laughter among the crowd).""
bud siegel, russell metals: ""i addressed the enron question last night during 
dinner and was told that i was abusive to the young lady from enron (tammy, i 
later understood that you had a less than cordial conversation with bud the 
previous evening). i am calling enron the ""hunts of the steel business"" with 
their idea of buying up the market. the whole concept is like swiss cheese. 
you can not put up depots, buy from steel mills, and expect to sell the same 
steel to distributors cheaper than the mills themselves. the logistical 
expenses alone guarantee failure. you can not be everything to everyone. 
considering the current state of under financing in this industry, they will 
inevitably end up financing bankrupt people and take credit hits. without 
immediate success, enron has been known to exist markets quickly in the past, 
and i believe they will be gone within the year.""(some sporadic applause)   
wilfried von bulow, ferrostaal: ""right now they are just another additional 
player in the market. they will certainly have an impact but it would not be 
pragmatic to make a judgment yet on their ability to succeed. let's watch it 
and see if there is any value to what they are trying to bring to the market.""
it appears to me that the focus on enron in the market right now continues to 
be more on the physical aspects of what we are doing and not enough emphasis 
or credibility is being given to the financial tools we are bringing. it is 
obviously very easy to poke holes in a concept of trading large volumes of 
physical steel on a ""spot"" basis through the set up of physical hubs around 
the country. in the end, the only way we will be successful will be by 
bringing liquidity to our index through financial instruments. we need to 
focus more on educating customers about our financial tools, developing our 
curve, and bringing players to the market.

Hi Maureen, 

I've tried to send an e-mail to Steve at S.Kean and Steve.Kean and both 
e-mails were returned to me as undeliverable.  Will you please forward this 
to Steve for me? 

Thanks.

Hi Steve,

Thanks again for meeting with me last week about ideas for saving money on 
Enron's videos.

You asked me whether or not our new ""Pro-Sumer"" field production equipment 
can download directly into e-mail.  The answer is yes and no.  The camera has 
a feature that will enable us to play back still pictures into e-mail or file 
storage.  We do not, however, have technology that will enable us to download 
moving video straight from the camera into a computer.  As far as we know, 
you still need to encode video for computer applications.  Now that we know 
that's something you're interested in doing, we'll keep our eye on the 
technology and let you know when it has been developed.

I talked with Mary about the ideas I presented to you, but have not yet 
talked with Mark Palmer.  I'm planning to send him an e-mail this afternoon.

I forgot to mention one thing to you about the ""creative piggybacking"" 
money-saving idea:  using a contractor to coordinate/piggyback video shoots 
is exactly what Microsoft does.  When we interviewed Steve Ballmer in 
January, we went to Microsoft's facilities and used Microsoft's crew.  Then 
they invoiced us for a whopping $1800.00 (for fewer than 15 minutes of 
shooting time).  

Steve, I hope that as your thoughts progress about Enron's video needs, 
you'll consider me to be part of the team.  I would like to help develop and 
be a part of the solutions.  

Beth Stier

Liz,

What about suggesting Friday, September 7 for the Santa Fe, Prediction Co, trip?
Greg would like to combine the trip with a weekend in Santa Fe.

We could go to Stanford on Thursday, the day before. 

Also, they want to speak about the agenda and the NDA. Can you ask Greg if
he wants to participate in the conference call? I want to propose Friday, 2:00 p.m. our time, for
a conference call. Given that they want to discuss the NDA, we could include the lawyer,
Mark Taylor, as well.

Vince

Tana,  Stephanie and I just confirmed that I still do not have full access to 
lotus notes.  I cannot, for example, edit any legal notes re: our 
brokerage/trading agreements.  Stephanie suggested that I ask you for 
guidance.


Stephanie, as per our discussion, in the meantime can you put the following 
updates in Lotus notes:

ITG POSIT:   Cheryl sent document for execution on 2/8.  Sheila Glover 
suggested changes to pricing schedule.  2/9 Cheryl called counsel regarding 
need to edit.

WSI:  2/9 Cheryl talked to John Bosse and recommended some material changes.  
Bosse is sending a forecast agreeemtn today so that some terms therein can be 
implemented into a final draft.  Will call on Monday to follow up.

Bear Sterns InterConnect:  2/9 Cheryl sent an email message to Christine 
Durlin and she responded.  We are in the process of discussing problematic 
issues re: arbitration and indemnification.  Bear Sterns apologized for the 
delay -- they admitted to losing the paperwork and changing personnel who 
were handling the agreement.  Cheryl and Christine plan to look into the 
issues and talk Monday or Tuesday.

Robertson Stephens:   2/9 Cheryl called Alberto Delgadillo again asking for 
the status on their legal review.  
2/5: Samantha called -- they said they never got the comments that our 
outside counsel sent on 1/5 so Samantha resent. 

JP Morgan: 2/9 & 2/1 Cheryl left message for status of their review of our 
comments.

Tana,

Per my message to you on Friday, Frank and I are planning on working through 
this tomorrow.  It may be a good idea if you can join us as you are familiar 
with this type of request.  In addition, the transactions they provided in 
the Exhibit do not have transaction numbers, I am going to need these 
transaction numbers to understand the exposure.  If they can not provide the 
transaction numbers, then is it possible for the Confirm group to provide the 
active transactions we have with Fletcher so I can cross reference them with 
the exposure we show in our credit system, and tie them back to the 
transaction detail they have provided.

Thanks
Russell

Subject: Assignment of Fletcher Challenge Swaps; Response to inquiry letter

Attached is an email I got from the lawyer for Fletcher Challenge.  
Obviously, he is on a short time frame, so we need to respond rather 
quickly.  Russell, we need some direction from Credit on how we want to 
proceed on this assignment.  Do you want to meet to go over this, and maybe 
give Bert a call, or what...?  Please let us know.

Tana:

This email is just a follow-up on the telephone message that I left for you 
earlier today.  As I explained, our firm (Chamberlain Hrdlicka) represents 
Apache Corporation and I will be replacing Saul Laureles in concluding our 
work related to the assignment of certain natural gas price swaps from 
Fletcher Challenge Industries Limited (""Fletcher Challenge"") to Shell 
Overseas Holdings Limited (""Shell""), and the reassignment from Shell to 
Apache Corporation. My contact information is as follows:

Robert J. Viguet, Jr. (""Bert"")
Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, White Williams & Martin
1200 Smith Street, Suite 1400
Houston, Texas 77056
Telephone:  713-654-9693
FAX:   713-658-2553
rviguet@chamberlainlaw.com

You should have received a letter from Saul Laureles dated February 6, 2001 
via overnight courier requesting that your firm confirm certain facts related 
to the swaps to be assigned as described above.  We are looking for a written 
response to that inquiry at your earliest opportunity.  If there are any 
errors or other discrepancies in the list of swap transactions or other 
matters identified in the letter, we need to know as soon as possible so that 
there will be time to resolve those issues before the assignments are made.

This firm (Chamberlain Hrdlicka) has prepared a draft of the Assignment and 
Assumption Agreements for the transfer of the swaps from Fletcher Challenge 
to Shell and from Shell to Apache Corporation. Our draft of the assignment 
forms is being reviewed by attorneys for Shell now, but should be available 
for your review in a few days. The acquisition of assets of Fletcher 
Challenge Energy by Shell and Apache, and the related assignments of the swap 
transactions, is expected to closes in early March.

If you have any questions or comments concerning the proposed transactions, 
please don't hesitate to contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

As we begin to meet with FERC Staff on the Wholesale market issues related to 
CA problems, I think that we need to put together a list of questions that 
FERC needs to be asking Western power market participants.  

The following are some questions that I think are important to have FERC ask; 
I'm sure there are more.

1. Were California utilities underscheduling load into the PX day ahead 
market?  
2. How many MWs did the CA ISO procure during each hour during the Summer 
2000?  How does this compare with CA ISO procurement during 1999?
3. Has PG&E changed its bidding behavior associated with its Hydro facilities 
in 2000?  
3. Are there baseload facilities that were operated differently in 2000 than 
in 1999?
4. Were any generation plants off-line due to unplanned maintenance during 
Summer 2000?
5. How did the CA ISO demand side program work?  Why didn't more load 
participate?  
6. What options did SDG&E have to ""hedge"" its retail rates?  What were prices 
in the CAL PX block forward market on Jan 15, 2000 and May 15, 2000?
7. How high did natural gas prices go in California for generation during 
Summer 2000?
8. Were other Western power markets prices higher (year-on-year)?
9. Did the CA ISO Board face political pressure to reduce bid caps?  Is this 
appropriate for a FERC jurisdictional entity?
10. What specific details is SDG&E referring to in its Complaint on 
""unworkably competitive"" CA ISO markets?  Can these be fixed ""quickly""?

Please add other questions.

Financial Analysts: Summary


> Governor  Davis' Lead Bond Counsel Holds Teleconference Today with
> Financial Analysts: Summary
> 
> The host of the teleconference was Mr. Joseph Fichera, CEO of Saber
> Partners (serving as Governor's independent Bond Counsel)
> 
> Mr. Fichera's goal appeared to be to calm the financial markets as the
> Governor is hoping under a best case scenario to put the bonds out to
> market sometime in June.  Fichera told me yesterday that he does these
> calls on an ""as needed"" basis.  There appeared to be some concern that the
> ""media is getting ahead of the story"" and the inference could be made that
> this is causing problems for the Governor's MOU legislation (which they
> also said they hope to have signed by June) and perhaps for the emerging
> ""Plan B"" as well.  
> 
> A replay of this teleconference is available at www.energyinfo.ca.gov.ca
> 
> Mr. Fichera broke down his statement into the following sections:
> 
> California State Senate: Pieces of Governor's MOU legislation moving in
> separate committees; in the Senate this is positive for moving it forward.
> 
> Assembly Plan B Group: Assemblymembers Keeley, Dutra and Nation are
> working together and have good ideas to move the Governor's MOU
> legislation through.  Fichera said that the Governor's office is meeting
> with both parties but the plan is still in the  formative stages.  He
> added that they still have the Senate to deal with and no movement on the
> proposal is imminent.  They are hopeful that it will be ""moving toward
> resolution in a week or two.""
> 
> Generators: Fichera stated that since the Governor's meeting with the
> generators, a subgroup has agreed to continue to meet with Governor's
> staff and advisors to resolve the issues.  He stated that the issue of
> litigation and investigations by the AG's office is ""off the table"" for
> discussion and that topics of discussion are limited to supply issues and
> managing the coming summer.
> 
> QFs: Governor's team has facilitated 5 days of discussions with SCE and
> QFs over past two weeks; most QFs are represented at these negotiations.
> They continue to discuss the back payments owed and lower prices going
> forward to give pricing stability to CDWR and the market.  Their hope is
> that due to negotiations, the QFS will all be fully available to the
> market this summer.
> 
> PGE:  They see the bankruptcy judge's refusal to allow certain QFs to get
> out of their contracts as a positive development. 
> 
> QFs on-line: There are currently 700 MWs off-line; this is better than
> their model anticipated for May.  They expect more than 90%
> on-line by June.  Last month 1700 QF MWs off-line; Fichera explained that
> standard QF contracts have severe penalties if not on by June 1 during
> peaks but that they are allowed to be off during off-peak hours.  He added
> that they are still trying to resolve their issues.
> 
> Key aspects of budget plan (by this I believe he meant energy financing,
> not the annual budget):  conservation and contracts
> 
> Conservation: They built in a 4% reduction in demand and 3% reduction for
> price elasticity--conservatively projecting  7% in conservation.  He
> stated the we saw 9% conservation in March and April, ""so we think our
> model is conservative.""  Fichera added that the new electricity rates go
> out in June and they expect that this will cause a ""good reaction"" due to
> price signals and demand reduction.
> 
> They also built in 2% in natural load growth to their projections as well
> to further ensure a conservative estimate.
> 
> Energy Costs: Projected ($1.78 billion) vs. actual ($1.80 billion) equals
> a variance of 1.4%
> 
> May Energy Costs:  As of May 6th, right on budget target, with a variance
> of less than a half percent
> 
> Contracts:  Fichera stated that DWR continues to execute new contracts and
> reduce the net short exposure in the spot market.  He added that 10-20% of
> necessary contracts are not yet executed, but rather in the agreement in
> principal stage.  He released the following stats:
> 
> Needed executed contracts completed (these percentages must refer to
> projected load accounted for): 43% for May, 67% for June, 48% for July,
> 42% for August
> 
> When agreements in principle added in: 73% for June, 67% for July, 60% for
> August:
> 
> Questions from analysts:
> 
> Have you built-in an assumption that QFs will be able to opt out of
> contracts?  ""No, we do not because we are fighting the opt-out positions.
> The bankruptcy judge refused to allow this and the AG is probably going to
> be involved to stop that.  A few hundred MWs have gone into the market.
> We are aware of this issue, which is why we're pushing the MOUs--this
> litigation would stop if we get an agreement on the MOU because the back
> payment issue would be settled.""
> 
> Timing with SDG&E,  where are you on MOU or Agreement in Principle?  We
> have to constantly reevaluate our negotiations   due to other decisions
> {happening simultaneously around us].  We are resuming face to face
> negotiations on Monday and we are still resolved to reach an agreement.
> There is no drop dead date.
> 
> Generators working group? We're discussing DWR credit issues, summer,
> support for MOU--the generators have issues with outstanding payments due.
> The Governor expects them to provide haircut re: those payments and that's
> part of discussion.
> 
> QF resolution: will gas QFs be released from contracts?  We don't know
> what PG&E is going to do but they could do that-- release at any time--no
> indications yet--haven't affirmed all the contracts yet.  We want to avoid
> this in the SCE situation.  There are a lot of overlapping QFs that supply
> both utilities.  We are trying to set a standard as to what we are looking
> for.
> 
> Bond issue timing? The current plan, assuming there is no further action
> by the legislature, is to close sales 91 days after bond sales, on Aug.
> 14.  We have sufficient cash to carry us through this period.  We are
> making a bridge loan from the General Fund.  In June we see improved
> revenue stream from ISO; rate increases will also improve cash stream.
> 
> Can you give us any prices on new contracts?  Not on new contracts, we are
> resisting for market reasons giving out individual prices for individual
> contracts.  Our website has aggregated average prices for contracts signed
> so far.
> 
> Where is the legislature?  Legislators want to see sharing of the pain--so
> far the focus has been mostly on generators.  The undercollection is
> associated so far with the generators, legislators are beginning to see
> that only about 1/3 of the undercollection is tied to generators.  So
> should QFs and commercial banks share the pain?  Some think some are less
> guilty than others.  We can only deal with Edison.  The media has gotten a
> little ahead of the process, this is going to take longer than a few
> weeks.  
> 
> Handicap?  Lead horse?  The Assembly is more organized and focused right
> now on enhancements and changes to the Governor's  plan; the Senate is not
> as organized, though we have engaged with Senator Burton--we met with him
> 3 times this week.  And the Senate Majority leader has sponsored a bill to
> implement the Governor's plan.
> 
> If QFs freed up from contracts under bankruptcy or otherwise released from
> contracts--how does this affect your financial plans?  ""I think it would
> change it dramatically.  It would be a budget busting event.""  That's why
> we're resisting in court and pushing the MOU and hope that the legislature
> sees why bankruptcy is not a viable solution.
> 
> Does this need to be solved before bond issue?  The combination of AB1x
> and 31x gives us ironclad bonding authority and the legal ability to
> recover all costs.  We think that only a few QFs can survive without
> long-term contracts, so it's also possible that not all would go into spot
> market, few may be able to survive as merchant generators.  
> 
> Windfall profits tax--helpfulness of generators--did they perform
> adequately during summer of 2000?  What are your expectations of their
> performance?  The Governor did not have a quantitative answer in mind--he
> left that open as to how he'll evaluate their performance. People at DWR
> and ISO will probably have the strongest influence on the Governor in this
> matter.
> 
> Bond issue timing?  We are working with the treasurer and hope to sell
> bonds by end of June ""if stars are aligned""--it may be one mega-deal or
> several tronches (sp?)--this is still open for discussion.  Even with the
> rising prices that we expect this summer, most of our net short will be
> under contract or reduced due to demand side management and thus we don't
> expect our budget to be busted.
> 
> Extended bridge financing commitment?--irrelevant because we don't have
> authority to issue for 90 days.
> 
> Renewable QFs/gas prices--is there anything can you do--levelize gas
> prices so they can operate under ""S-rack"" (sp?) price formula?
> 
> Many options have been discussed, to bring them into the market we need
> such issues to become part of the global settlement and to continue to be
> worked out.
> 
> Polanco MOU legislation: is it identical to the Governor's view or already
> changed?  This is the implementing legislation for the Governor's MOU--not
> changed so far.  Governor did not put MOU on table as legislation that
> could be changed. (He went on to explain that anything taken out must be
> replaced in some other fashion to keep the MOU balanced...) This is going
> to take some time; however, we do have a sense of urgency--we are hoping
> for a vote sometime in June.  The MOU has deadline of August 15.

> 
> bond issue timing?  we are working with the treasurer and hope to sell

Attached please find a revised First Amendment Agreement which amends Section 
2 of the Flow of Funds memo to add a provision directing ECS to pay to ENA 
the extra $30,488 it was wired by ECHO, and adding a clause to Section 
3(a)(ii) to reflect that ECS is to use such extra wired amount to satisfy 
such obligation.   We trust this accommodates both ECS and ECHO, and hope to 
move forward with execution tomorrow (Wednesday 6/28).  Please contact us as 
soon as possible with any further comments and to coordinate execution.

Chris,

   Columbia Marketing has some outstanding invoices from Jan - Mar of this 
year
for gathering and processing charges against contract 50140 IGS.  I talked 
with
Doug Kinney at CES, and he referred me to you.  Should Enron be paying these
charges?  Do you need me to send copies of the invoices to you, or do you have
an accounting contact for me?

   Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

   PS  Credit tells me that the Jan Gulf invoice is outstanding, also.

Dear Carol

Under Bermuda law, there is no real concept of ""perfecting"" security since it 
is not necessary to ensure the enforceability in Bermuda that a charge be 
registered in Bermuda.  However, although it is not necessary for a security 
interest to be registered in order for it to be valid, the charge document 
itself can be registered in Bermuda in the Register of Charges in accordance 
with Section 55 of the Companies Act 1981 in order to ensure the priority in 
Bermuda of the charge.  On registration, any charge evidenced in the charging 
document will have priority over any unregistered competing charge or any 
subsequently registered competing charge in respect of the assets which are 
the subject of the charge (i.e. the cash).

If the agreement will be governed by either Texas or New York law, it will be 
a matter of the laws of either Texas or New York as to the actual nature of 
the security interest which is created by the charge.

If you would like us to effect the registration of the charge, we would need 
an original (or a certified true copy) of the executed document which creates 
the security interest.  There is no time limit on such registration.  
However, please note that, in addition to our professional fees, there is a 
filing fee of $446 which is payable in respect of the registration.

I trust that the above is of some assistance.  If you have any questions 
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards.

Chris Garrod

We have done a trade with a Bermuda hedge fund and have negotiated
collateral provisions that may require them to post csah to us.  The
agreement will be governed by either Texas or New York law.  We need your
advice on how to perfect our interest in any cash posted to us that we
would hold in an account in the United States.  Could you please call
either me or Sara Shackelton (713)853-5620 if possible tomorrow or you can
send me an e-mail if that is easier.  I'm hoping that our possession of the
cash is enough.  Sorry for the short fuse on this.  If you need any
additional information, please contact me or Sara.  I will be unavailable
from 9-11 and 2-3 tomorrow Houston time.

under bermuda law, there is no real concept of ""perfecting"" security since it 
is not necessary to ensure the enforceability in bermuda that a charge be 
registered in bermuda.  however, although it is not necessary for a security 
interest to be registered in order for it to be valid, the charge document 
itself can be registered in bermuda in the register of charges in accordance 
with section 55 of the companies act 1981 in order to ensure the priority in 
bermuda of the charge.  on registration, any charge evidenced in the charging 
document will have priority over any unregistered competing charge or any 
subsequently registered competing charge in respect of the assets which are 
the subject of the charge (i.e. the cash).

if the agreement will be governed by either texas or new york law, it will be 
a matter of the laws of either texas or new york as to the actual nature of 
the security interest which is created by the charge.

if you would like us to effect the registration of the charge, we would need 
an original (or a certified true copy) of the executed document which creates 
the security interest.  there is no time limit on such registration.  
however, please note that, in addition to our professional fees, there is a 
filing fee of $446 which is payable in respect of the registration.

i trust that the above is of some assistance.  if you have any questions 
please do not hesitate to contact me.

kind regards.

christopher:
we have done a trade with a bermuda hedge fund and have negotiated
collateral provisions that may require them to post csah to us.  the
agreement will be governed by either texas or new york law.  we need your
advice on how to perfect our interest in any cash posted to us that we
would hold in an account in the united states.  could you please call
either me or sara shackelton (713)853-5620 if possible tomorrow or you can
send me an e-mail if that is easier.  i'm hoping that our possession of the
cash is enough.  sorry for the short fuse on this.  if you need any
additional information, please contact me or sara.  i will be unavailable
from 9-11 and 2-3 tomorrow houston time.

I am attaching a revised copy of the agreement. TVA has agreed to these 
changes.
TVA supplied the basic changes and we intervened in a couple of cases where 
we did not think they met our agreements.
My  comments to are as follows:
I believe the second bullet is better stated than the original one we 
submitted. We support this wording.
In the last paragraph, if Enron also supports the wording related to ENNA and 
ENCA we need to include your name in the sentence.
Please disregard the original document and let's work from this one.
Thanks

I thought that it would be easier to e-mail you since we keep missing each 
other on the phone.  All of the St. Clair's are doing well.  Charles keeps 
growing.  At his last visit last week he was 11 1/2 pounds and 22 inches.  
Needless to say he likes to eat.  He is gradually starting to sleep more at 
night but is still pretty unpredictable and I've just gotten used to not 
getting alot of sleep.  Having Bill home with me is a big help and it makes 
it alot easier for me since we can trade off.

Physically, I am feeling almost 100%.  I started running a few weeks ago just 
to keep my sanity and have started playing tennis again although it is going 
to take a long time for me to get back into playing shape.  Arthur is very 
much into tennis and I am enjoying getting to watch him play.  He played in 
his first tournament over the weekend and did very well.  Bill and I are 
hoping that he keeps it up.  He has been great with the baby as I expected.  
He is a calming influence on him and really interacts well with him.  I feel 
very, very fortunate.

How are you doing and how are the boys?  I miss work and the interaction with 
everyone, but at the same time I am enjoying my time at home.  I think that 
you know how I must feel and I'm glad that I still have some time to think 
about it.  I can't imagine having to go back after 6 weeks as I am just 
beginning to feel good physically.  Carol St. Clair

Arthur is back in school and is a big help at home.  I'm enjoying being home 
with him when he gets home from school and its nice to be able to visit him 
while he is in school.

I hope that you are doing well and not killing yourself up there.  How are 
your parents doing?  Please give them my best.  I keep promising to come up 
for a visit and I will soon.  Tomorrow (Thursday) may be a possibility.  Hope 
to see you soon.  Take care.

Greetings, Sandra.  I hope life will be treating you better over there
soon.  As you might know, most of EnergyUSA was given pink slips effective
over the next 3-6 months.  As a result, it is back looking for another job.
I was wondering if it would be possible for you to write a letter of
recommendation for me?   I'm really regretting this leave from Enron now.
In my quest for looking for something stable, I ended up fucking myself up.
At least I have a few months before our house is finished.  Hopefully, I'll
have something by then.

Subject: Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as Agent

With respect to this new counterparty for EnronOnline (correct name to 
follow):

Sam Schott advises us that we are limited to 90 characters for a counterparty 
name in GCP.  The correct legal name for this counterparty is longer than 90 
characters.  I discussed this with Marcus Nettelton, our power lawyer, and if 
the following scenario meets with the approval of the financial and physical 
power Confirmation Desks we think the best way to treat this matter is to set 
the counterparty up in GCP as follows and then add this counterparty to the 
special handling list so all confirmations, physical and financial, offline 
and online, go out with the LEGAL NAME, not with the GCP NAME.

LEGAL NAME OF COUNTERPARTY:  Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as 
authorized agent for and on behalf of IES Utilities Inc., Interstate Power 
Company, and Wisconsin Power and Light Company

SUGGESTED NAME FOR GCP:   Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as Agent 
for three listed utilities

Joe and Kim, is this workable for the Confirm Desks?  If you can let me and 
Sam know then Sam can get them set us.

Thanks for your help!

Tana/Mark,
Columbia Gulf has requested the following changes to their NDA. The legal entity name should read ""Columbia Gulf Transmission Company.""  They would also like to add point number 9 which states, "" The execution of this agreement relative to confidential information does not obligate either party to enter into any other agreement or any transaction as that term is referenced herein.""

As long as you don't have any issues with the changes, please forward a copy to Jim Hart at Columbia.  They are scheduled to come over for a demo next week.

Michelle,

The name of the DB Administrator for Enpower is Charlene Fricker,
5-3487. Alex will contact her regarding the access to the curve.

I think it's a problem many layers below Gary Hickerson's level
of responsibility and I hope we can handle it without using his valuable
time.

Dan,

Attached below is another Netting Agreement that this counteparty would like 
to have executed.  This is mainly an active Canadian counterparty (where we 
have all contracts executed with ECC) but they also do business with ENA.  
The exposures are getting significant enough where they are needing netting 
arrangements.  

Please take a look at this draft that they have forwarded below.  If you find 
it unacceptable, let me know and I will communicate it to the counterparty 
and forward ours.  They initiated this and preferred we view their ""simple"" 
document.

Thanks,

Veronica

Stan,

I have one minor question.  

Is the Notice to Proceed Effective Date a set date, or is it x days following 
y event? 

I would expect to see language along the lines of ""If notice to proceed is 
not given by the Notice to Proceed Effective Date, then..."".  I see the 
deleted language was something close to that, so maybe in the context of this 
EPC different terminology is used.

Kay

Creditors Chafe at State's Pace on Power Crisis 


By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writers


     The California energy crisis is hurtling along two tracks--one the slow 
lane of legislative politics, the other the hyper-speed autobahn of high 
finance. 

     As Stage 3 electricity alerts and billion-dollar debts mount, some 
travelers on those intersecting byways are strapping themselves in for what 
they see as a looming pileup, perhaps at the doors of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court. 

     Wall Street is becoming increasingly irritated with the deliberative 
pace of the California Legislature and Gov. Gray Davis and his months of 
unfulfilled vows of a remedy. 

     Those owed money by Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & 
Electric said Wednesday that they cannot not wait forever to be paid. 

     ""The pace of progress is not sufficient,"" said Joe Bob Perkins, 
president of Reliant Energy, a major power supplier in the state. ""Our 
accounts receivable from the past aren't being taken care of and the bleeding 
is growing."" 

     In Sacramento, no immediate first aid is on the way. 
     Davis, who says he will announce his latest plan to solve the utilities' 
financial meltdown on Friday, left little doubt on Wednesday that he intends 
to press for a state takeover of the massive electricity transmission system, 
despite its huge value to the utilities. But key legislators predict that, no 
matter what the governor proposes, they are at least two weeks away from 
passing legislation to improve the situation. 

     Bob Foster, the Edison official who oversees governmental affairs, said 
the question of bankruptcy is ""a day-to-day thing. There are signs that 
creditors are getting increasingly nervous, increasingly impatient."" 

     ""We were told last week that there will be a proposal from the 
administration, and we're still waiting,"" Foster said. 

     Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) said that if 
Davis and lawmakers cannot resolve the matter within the next two weeks, ""we 
aren't going to be able to solve it, and it will be in other people's hands."" 

     Edison and PG&E have said they do not want to file for bankruptcy 
protection and will do so only if forced by their creditors. A prelude to 
bankruptcy, the formation of creditors committees, already has begun. Each 
utility can be forced into bankruptcy by as few as three creditors owed as 
little as $10,775 in unsecured debts, bankruptcy experts say. 

     ""We respectfully believe that the state has less time than they might 
otherwise think,"" Gary Dunton, president and chief executive officer of MBIA 
Inc., a firm that insures $1.3 billion of the utilities' debt. 

     ""If someone called me an hour from now [to announce a bankruptcy 
filing],"" Dunton added, ""I wouldn't be surprised. We have been very clear 
that we are frustrated with the timing, and apparent lack of urgency. 

     ""If you have 100 people cooking a stew, it may never be edible."" 
     Not everyone, however, believes that the prolonged legislative process 
will make much difference in the long run, despite the howls from creditors' 
and utilities. 

     ""I don't sense that there is a sense of urgency,"" said Assemblyman 
George Runner Jr. (R-Lancaster). Runner, like other legislators, pointed to 
repeated deadlines that have come and gone without a bankruptcy, and said: 
""Crying wolf can go so far."" 

     Some legislators blame Davis for the delays. 

     ""The Legislature will pass enabling legislation. But people are waiting 
to hear from [the governor's] corner office,"" said Assembly Republican leader 
Bill Campbell of Villa Park, who has not conferred with Davis for a week. ""We 
think it is serious. But it is a frustrating situation."" 

     Some lawmakers in Sacramento believe that not all the legislative gears 
are in sync, thus complicating progress. They say Davis has positioned 
himself politically so that the Legislature will carry the brunt of the blame 
when potential rate increases come into effect. 

     ""The governor is out there saying no more rate increases and that he's 
on the side of consumers, while we have to do the dirty work,"" fumed an 
Assembly Democrat, who requested anonymity out of fear that his comments 
would only inflame an already tense relationship between the executive and 
the Legislature. 

     That irritation grew among Assembly Democrats when a poll they recently 
commissioned showed the Legislature's approval rating had dropped 25 points, 
while Davis' rating remained relatively high. The poll, conducted in late 
January by the Sacramento firm Moore Methods, showed Davis with a 45% 
approval rating, compared with only 25% for the Legislature. 

     Meanwhile, the cost to the state treasury of buying power is rocketing 
toward $2 billion, as the Department of Water Resources buys electricity 
because utilities are no longer able to borrow money. 

     ""Giving [away] $2 billion that could have gone to build schools, 
housing, highways and help lower taxes for consumers . . . is a moral 
outrage,"" said Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights. 

     In the meantime, the electricity bills--and defaults by the two 
utilities--continue to swell with no end in sight. 

     California's power plant owners, already frustrated by the hundreds of 
millions of dollars they haven't been paid by the state's two biggest 
utilities, fear that the debt is growing by millions of dollars a day--even 
after the state ponied up taxpayers money to buy electricity for the 
utilities. That's because power purchasers for the state are refusing to pay 
for all of the electricity that grid operators order on a last-minute basis 
to prevent blackouts. 

     Growing anxious over the slow pace of progress in Sacramento, generators 
are looking for help from the courts and from state and federal regulators. 
They won a victory Wednesday when federal regulators ruled that power 
suppliers cannot be forced to bear the risk that they won't get paid when 
grid operators order them to supply emergency power. 

     Davis said Wednesday that the ongoing snags in buying power are being 
worked out. The lingering problem of the utilities' estimated $12.7 billion 
in electricity debts, Davis said, can be fixed by the state's purchase of the 
transmission grid. The money paid to the utilities for the grid--which would 
have to be negotiated--plus lease payments the state would make to the 
utilities to continue operating the 32,000 miles of high-voltage wires, would 
infuse the companies with enough cash to restructure their debt. 

     ""We're talking about a financial transaction that has value to both 
sides,"" Davis said. ""It has become increasingly clear to me that we cannot 
accomplish that without purchasing the transmission lines."" 

     Although Davis voiced his support of taking over the utilities' 
moneymaking transmission system, he has not conferred with companies' 
executives for a week. In fact, they learned of it from press accounts. 

     ""It's all just a giant game of chicken,"" a top utility executive said, 
asking that he not be identified. ""But I'm worried that the administration is 
going to overplay its hand and leave us with no options.""

Lorraine, I have no problem with Larry's proposed change or his reasons for 
the change.  However, I would ask that we eliminate the word ""volumetric"" as 
that has other connotations in the FERC tariff world.  I.e., if we were truly 
to have ""volumetric"" rates (like Northern) we'd have to file a whole new rate 
schedule!  I just don't want to use this word.  I don't think it's necessary 
in order to convey Larry's meaning.  Why don't we insert:  ""on a daily basis  
only   to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized"".  
If Larry wants to talk about it I'm happy to.  If he comes up with any more 
issues I am sending him to law school as punishment.

Lorraine, 
I have your revised letter.? There is only one thing that seems subject to 
possible questions about the intent.? Paragraph 3, last sentence.? I suggest 
it be revised as follows: 

"".....and Transwestern's maximum rates shall apply on a daily, volumetric 
basis to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized."" 

This would reflect how I read the Tariff provisions to apply.? As written 
now, someone could infer that ALL volumes go to max rates whenever ANY 
volumes are moved from/to an unspecified alternate point.? I am visualizing a 
nomination day with part of the volumes from Primary or one of these 
specified points and part of the volumes from some other unspecified 
alternate point. 

Then, just a general question.? Are any of these named alternates also 
delivery points, as well as receipt points?? Are there any delivery points in 
these areas that should be recognized? 

I will talk to you first thing in the morning. 
Thanks.

",susan.scott@enron.com,"lorraine, i have no problem with larry's proposed change or his reasons for 
the change.  however, i would ask that we eliminate the word ""volumetric"" as 
that has other connotations in the ferc tariff world.  i.e., if we were truly 
to have ""volumetric"" rates (like northern) we'd have to file a whole new rate 
schedule!  i just don't want to use this word.  i don't think it's necessary 
in order to convey larry's meaning.  why don't we insert:  ""on a daily basis  
only   to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized"".  
if larry wants to talk about it i'm happy to.  if he comes up with any more 
issues i am sending him to law school as punishment.

lorraine, 
i have your revised letter.? there is only one thing that seems subject to 
possible questions about the intent.? paragraph 3, last sentence.? i suggest 
it be revised as follows: 

"".....and transwestern's maximum rates shall apply on a daily, volumetric 
basis to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized."" 

this would reflect how i read the tariff provisions to apply.? as written 
now, someone could infer that all volumes go to max rates whenever any 
volumes are moved from/to an unspecified alternate point.? i am visualizing a 
nomination day with part of the volumes from primary or one of these 
specified points and part of the volumes from some other unspecified 
alternate point. 

then, just a general question.? are any of these named alternates also 
delivery points, as well as receipt points?? are there any delivery points in 
these areas that should be recognized? 

i will talk to you first thing in the morning.

Hey,

I did think of something Dad might want.  He was really excited when mom gave 
him the Biblical reference book for Father's day, so maybe we could get him 
something like that.  Call mom and ask her what he wants.

What's It Worth To You?

Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.
- Oscar Wilde

Certainly too few consumers and policymakers understand the value of renewable energy products - products that avoid the acid rain, smog, global warming, and soot pollution caused by mainly coal-burning power plants. Perhaps with the removal of stranded cost charges from consumers' bills next year, the Duquesne Light service territory will be the first market where both price and value of renewable energy are understood and motivate large numbers of customers to buy (see case studies that follow).

Moreover, a new study published in the August 24, 2001 edition of Science, by Mark Z. Jacobson and Gilbert M. Masters of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University, shows that the ""cost gap"" between coal power and the cheapest forms of renewable energy is narrowing sharply, down to about 0.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Most importantly, professors Jacobson and Masters document that the apparently slightly lower cost of coal generation is more illusion than reality, due to its real costs.

When coal generation's environmental and health costs like damage to air, water and forests, as well as human illness and death, are included in the calculation, coal generation's real price jumps to about 5.5 cents to 8.3 cents per kWh. By comparison, the 4.0 cents to 5.0 cents cost of wind energy makes it a bargain. 

""Wind energy is unequivocally less expensive than is coal energy,"" say Jacobson and Masters.

How Much Is That Kilowatt-Hour?
It's not surprising that few know the value of renewable energy products in electricity markets where many real pollution costs from burning fossil fuels are not included in the price of electricity and where many consumers still don't know the link between electricity generation and environmental and health damage. 

Yet lack of knowledge goes beyond value in electricity markets. Consumer inexperience with these markets and the complex transition to competition make electricity an exception to the rule that people know the price of everything. 

Even sophisticated observers don't know the price of comparative products, regardless of the added environmental and public health costs. Price transparency is a bad joke, because stranded cost charges make understanding price as easy as getting a clear view on a smoggy day in Houston.

In those states that allow customers to choose a generation supplier, few consumers and policymakers know what their local utility charged for generation prior to competition, including what are now called stranded costs. Perhaps even fewer know how prices alone, not including the stranded cost charges, of today's competitive products compare to their utilities' unbundled generation rates charged prior to competition. Or how today's renewable energy prices compare to utilities' pre-competition generation rates. 

And how many know how today's price to compare or default rate compares to the pre-competition, monopoly generation rate (which includes stranded costs)? Confusion on these basic questions is widespread and distorts perception and policy. 

It is vital for policymakers to know the answers in order to formulate wise policy (see for answers, ""It's All in the Numbers,"" E3, Vol. 3 No. 12). But even that's only the foundation of what is perhaps a much tougher question about electricity: ""What is it worth?"" 

An important change that will affect the answer is on the horizon. Beginning in February, 2002, stranded cost charges will be eliminated from electric bills in the Pittsburgh area. These are payments made to Duquesne, primarily to cover its prior investments in uneconomic, nuclear generation, recovered from consumers through the Competitive Transition Charge (CTC).

The following examples of typical types of customer bills in the Duquesne Light territory illustrate comparative prices at pre-restructuring or present default rates, the new default rates that will take effect next year, and for various renewable energy products. 

These examples will hopefully clear away some of the haze surrounding the true price of renewable products.

Residential Customers
A typical residential customer (rate RS) using 600 kWh per month has been paying Duquesne Light about $75 per month since rates were capped in 1996. Of this monthly $75 bill, about $48 is for total generation costs and the rest is for distribution services.

In turn, more than $20 of the $48 total generation cost reflects stranded cost charges. Since customer choice began, all 600 kWh residential customers - including those choosing a competitive supplier - have had to pay Duquesne the same $20 for stranded costs. If customers were not required to pay Duquesne for its stranded costs, this typical customer's total bill would be less than $55, a whopping 27 percent less than it is now.

As a result of stranded cost charges, customers choosing a competitive supplier can only avoid paying Duquesne about $28 of its $48 generation rate, where the $28 reflects the ""shopping credit"" or price to compare that has been available. So, only if a customer could buy 600 kWh per month for less than $28, including transmission, would s/he save money by switching to a competitive supplier. 

As you can see, stranded cost charges and the weird economics and pricing they produce make it difficult to know the price of electricity, let alone the value of renewable generation. 

If our typical residential consumer purchased renewable generation today for 6.0 cents/kWh, the consumer would pay $36 for generation - $12 per month less than the historic regulated generation rate of $48. At a rate of 7.0 cents/kWh, the same consumer would pay $42 for renewable generation, or $6 per month less. The price for renewable generation must be over 8.0 cents/kWh for the consumer to pay more for it than what residential consumers paid their regulated utility for mostly coal and nuclear power. 

There are presently four competitive suppliers offering five renewable energy products in Duquesne's territory (three are Green-e certified), for prices ranging from 6.5 cents to 7.0 cents/kWh. Renewable generation today costs substantially less than coal and nuclear generation did prior to competition. Yet, the $20 stranded cost charge that a 600 kWh renewable energy residential customer must pay in the Duquesne service territory has concealed not just the value of renewable energy, but also its real price. 

Until February, a customer buying renewable generation for 7.0 cents/kWh - or $6 less than the pre-competition rate - will still have a total bill, including CTCs and distribution charges, that is $12 more than their current bill. While many might find that $12 more per month for cleaner energy and its associated benefits is still reasonable, many more who are motivated by their wallets alone probably would not. But a great opportunity is about to open up for renewable products as CTCs in the Duquesne Light territory are about to be eliminated. 

While the Public Utility Commission still hasn't established what the new regulated rates will be, it appears that a typical 600 kWh per month customer who buys generation from Duquesne/Orion will receive a rate reduction of about 16 percent, saving about $12 per month. However, customers won't receive the full savings from the elimination of CTCs because a portion will cover the costs of Duquesne's integration into the PJM-West Independent System Operator.

But as soon as the stranded cost charges are removed, a typical residential consumer could buy renewable energy products and pay less than what s/he paid for electricity under default rates, and less than s/he paid in 1996. Both the price and value will then be motivating factors for buying renewable energy.

When the CTC is removed, the residential customer using 600 kWh per month will soon be able to use the savings to buy wind energy to serve one-third of his/her load - for a total of $68, or a savings of $7 compared to today's default rate. Even if the customer were to buy all of his/her electricity from one of the new wind farms being built in southwestern Pennsylvania, the customer would pay less than $3 more per month than s/he is currently paying for default generation.

If the customer chooses a blended product with both renewable and non-renewable content for 6.0 cents/kWh, the monthly bill would be $5 less than what it is today. Even at a price of 7.0 cents/kWh, the monthly bill for a blended product would be less than $1 per month more, or only about $8 more per year, than the price currently paid for default service of mostly nuclear and dirty coal-generated power.

The end of CTCs in Duquesne's territory will allow a residential customer to switch from traditional, dirty generation to renewable generation and still save money, or pay only pennies more.

Business and Institutional Customers
The dollar impact for larger customers is somewhat higher, but equally small in the context of total electricity bills or company budgets. For example, a small commercial customer on rate GS/M, such as a restaurant or convenience store, using 10,000 kWh per month and with a demand of 23 kW, has been paying $808.52 per month for regulated or default service. 

With elimination of the CTC and the PJM-West integration costs, their bills will likely decrease about 11 percent, for a total monthly bill of about $720, a savings of about $88 per month. A small commercial customer could use the savings to buy enough wind energy to meet 25 percent of its load - saving about $26 per month compared to present bills, and still paying less for electricity than in 1996.

A large commercial/industrial customer on rate GL, such as a large hotel, hospital or a small college or manufacturer, using 1.168 million kWh/month and a demand of 2,000 kW has been paying about $69,440 per month for regulated or default service. With elimination of the CTC, the bill will likely decrease about 8 percent beginning around September, 2002, for a total monthly bill of around $63,900; a savings of about $5,540 per month. 

Those substantial savings could then be invested in purchasing renewable energy without increasing electricity bills above either current or 1996 levels. For example, a hospital could serve 30 percent of its load with a blended product for 5.5 cents/kWh and still save about $1,225 per month compared to its current default bill. Two hospitals could purchase the entire output of one of the new wind turbines in southwestern Pennsylvania to supply over 15 percent of their total electricity requirements and still save about $5,200 per month compared to their present bills. Even if a single hospital purchased the output of an entire wind turbine, enough to serve 31.4 percent of its load, the total additional cost of $3,209 per month would be only about $3,840 more per year than their current default bill.

For hospitals, which must fight the devastating health effects of dirty coal-generated power every day, how much is that worth?

Municipal consumers on rate SM for street lighting, using 110,000 kWh per month, have been paying $33,130 per month for regulated and default electricity. With elimination of the CTC, the bill would decrease to $27,220, but with the PJM-West transition costs the bill may decrease about 14.5 percent, for a total monthly bill of $28,320; a savings of about $4,810 per month.  About three municipal customers with that consumption level could join together to purchase the output of one of the new wind turbines in southwestern Pennsylvania to meet their entire electricity load and still save about $2,850 per month each, compared to their current default costs. A single municipal customer could still save about $880 per month compared to their current bill if they purchased a blended product at 6.0 cents per kWh. 

What *is* it worth?
What will renewable energy be worth to Pittsburgh's families, businesses, institutions and governments? Buying renewable is the single best thing any consumer can do to protect our environment and public health. Its value is great and its price in Pittsburgh will become less distorted with the removal of stranded cost charges from consumers' bills next year. The savings of $20 per month for a typical residential customer and much more for typical commercial, industrial, and municipal accounts, gives Pittsburgh a great opportunity to become America's first green-powered city. The price of that opportunity will cost less than what consumers paid for dirty power in 1996 or even what many are paying now. 

The value of that opportunity is priceless.

when coal generation's environmental and health costs like damage to air, water and forests, as well as human illness and death, are included in the calculation, coal generation's real price jumps to about 5.5 cents to 8.3 cents per kwh. by comparison, the 4.0 cents to 5.0 cents cost of wind energy makes it a bargain. 

""wind energy is unequivocally less expensive than is coal energy,"" say jacobson and masters.

how much is that kilowatt-hour?
it's not surprising that few know the value of renewable energy products in electricity markets where many real pollution costs from burning fossil fuels are not included in the price of electricity and where many consumers still don't know the link between electricity generation and environmental and health damage. 

yet lack of knowledge goes beyond value in electricity markets. consumer inexperience with these markets and the complex transition to competition make electricity an exception to the rule that people know the price of everything. 

even sophisticated observers don't know the price of comparative products, regardless of the added environmental and public health costs. price transparency is a bad joke, because stranded cost charges make understanding price as easy as getting a clear view on a smoggy day in houston.

in those states that allow customers to choose a generation supplier, few consumers and policymakers know what their local utility charged for generation prior to competition, including what are now called stranded costs. perhaps even fewer know how prices alone, not including the stranded cost charges, of today's competitive products compare to their utilities' unbundled generation rates charged prior to competition. or how today's renewable energy prices compare to utilities' pre-competition generation rates. 

and how many know how today's price to compare or default rate compares to the pre-competition, monopoly generation rate (which includes stranded costs)? confusion on these basic questions is widespread and distorts perception and policy. 

it is vital for policymakers to know the answers in order to formulate wise policy (see for answers, ""it's all in the numbers,"" e3, vol. 3 no. 12). but even that's only the foundation of what is perhaps a much tougher question about electricity: ""what is it worth?"" 

an important change that will affect the answer is on the horizon. beginning in february, 2002, stranded cost charges will be eliminated from electric bills in the pittsburgh area. these are payments made to duquesne, primarily to cover its prior investments in uneconomic, nuclear generation, recovered from consumers through the competitive transition charge (ctc).

the following examples of typical types of customer bills in the duquesne light territory illustrate comparative prices at pre-restructuring or present default rates, the new default rates that will take effect next year, and for various renewable energy products. 

these examples will hopefully clear away some of the haze surrounding the true price of renewable products.

residential customers
a typical residential customer (rate rs) using 600 kwh per month has been paying duquesne light about $75 per month since rates were capped in 1996. of this monthly $75 bill, about $48 is for total generation costs and the rest is for distribution services.

in turn, more than $20 of the $48 total generation cost reflects stranded cost charges. since customer choice began, all 600 kwh residential customers - including those choosing a competitive supplier - have had to pay duquesne the same $20 for stranded costs. if customers were not required to pay duquesne for its stranded costs, this typical customer's total bill would be less than $55, a whopping 27 percent less than it is now.

as a result of stranded cost charges, customers choosing a competitive supplier can only avoid paying duquesne about $28 of its $48 generation rate, where the $28 reflects the ""shopping credit"" or price to compare that has been available. so, only if a customer could buy 600 kwh per month for less than $28, including transmission, would s/he save money by switching to a competitive supplier. 

as you can see, stranded cost charges and the weird economics and pricing they produce make it difficult to know the price of electricity, let alone the value of renewable generation. 

if our typical residential consumer purchased renewable generation today for 6.0 cents/kwh, the consumer would pay $36 for generation - $12 per month less than the historic regulated generation rate of $48. at a rate of 7.0 cents/kwh, the same consumer would pay $42 for renewable generation, or $6 per month less. the price for renewable generation must be over 8.0 cents/kwh for the consumer to pay more for it than what residential consumers paid their regulated utility for mostly coal and nuclear power. 

there are presently four competitive suppliers offering five renewable energy products in duquesne's territory (three are green-e certified), for prices ranging from 6.5 cents to 7.0 cents/kwh. renewable generation today costs substantially less than coal and nuclear generation did prior to competition. yet, the $20 stranded cost charge that a 600 kwh renewable energy residential customer must pay in the duquesne service territory has concealed not just the value of renewable energy, but also its real price. 

until february, a customer buying renewable generation for 7.0 cents/kwh - or $6 less than the pre-competition rate - will still have a total bill, including ctcs and distribution charges, that is $12 more than their current bill. while many might find that $12 more per month for cleaner energy and its associated benefits is still reasonable, many more who are motivated by their wallets alone probably would not. but a great opportunity is about to open up for renewable products as ctcs in the duquesne light territory are about to be eliminated. 

while the public utility commission still hasn't established what the new regulated rates will be, it appears that a typical 600 kwh per month customer who buys generation from duquesne/orion will receive a rate reduction of about 16 percent, saving about $12 per month. however, customers won't receive the full savings from the elimination of ctcs because a portion will cover the costs of duquesne's integration into the pjm-west independent system operator.

but as soon as the stranded cost charges are removed, a typical residential consumer could buy renewable energy products and pay less than what s/he paid for electricity under default rates, and less than s/he paid in 1996. both the price and value will then be motivating factors for buying renewable energy.

when the ctc is removed, the residential customer using 600 kwh per month will soon be able to use the savings to buy wind energy to serve one-third of his/her load - for a total of $68, or a savings of $7 compared to today's default rate. even if the customer were to buy all of his/her electricity from one of the new wind farms being built in southwestern pennsylvania, the customer would pay less than $3 more per month than s/he is currently paying for default generation.

if the customer chooses a blended product with both renewable and non-renewable content for 6.0 cents/kwh, the monthly bill would be $5 less than what it is today. even at a price of 7.0 cents/kwh, the monthly bill for a blended product would be less than $1 per month more, or only about $8 more per year, than the price currently paid for default service of mostly nuclear and dirty coal-generated power.

the end of ctcs in duquesne's territory will allow a residential customer to switch from traditional, dirty generation to renewable generation and still save money, or pay only pennies more.

business and institutional customers
the dollar impact for larger customers is somewhat higher, but equally small in the context of total electricity bills or company budgets. for example, a small commercial customer on rate gs/m, such as a restaurant or convenience store, using 10,000 kwh per month and with a demand of 23 kw, has been paying $808.52 per month for regulated or default service. 

with elimination of the ctc and the pjm-west integration costs, their bills will likely decrease about 11 percent, for a total monthly bill of about $720, a savings of about $88 per month. a small commercial customer could use the savings to buy enough wind energy to meet 25 percent of its load - saving about $26 per month compared to present bills, and still paying less for electricity than in 1996.

a large commercial/industrial customer on rate gl, such as a large hotel, hospital or a small college or manufacturer, using 1.168 million kwh/month and a demand of 2,000 kw has been paying about $69,440 per month for regulated or default service. with elimination of the ctc, the bill will likely decrease about 8 percent beginning around september, 2002, for a total monthly bill of around $63,900; a savings of about $5,540 per month. 

those substantial savings could then be invested in purchasing renewable energy without increasing electricity bills above either current or 1996 levels. for example, a hospital could serve 30 percent of its load with a blended product for 5.5 cents/kwh and still save about $1,225 per month compared to its current default bill. two hospitals could purchase the entire output of one of the new wind turbines in southwestern pennsylvania to supply over 15 percent of their total electricity requirements and still save about $5,200 per month compared to their present bills. even if a single hospital purchased the output of an entire wind turbine, enough to serve 31.4 percent of its load, the total additional cost of $3,209 per month would be only about $3,840 more per year than their current default bill.

for hospitals, which must fight the devastating health effects of dirty coal-generated power every day, how much is that worth?

municipal consumers on rate sm for street lighting, using 110,000 kwh per month, have been paying $33,130 per month for regulated and default electricity. with elimination of the ctc, the bill would decrease to $27,220, but with the pjm-west transition costs the bill may decrease about 14.5 percent, for a total monthly bill of $28,320; a savings of about $4,810 per month.  about three municipal customers with that consumption level could join together to purchase the output of one of the new wind turbines in southwestern pennsylvania to meet their entire electricity load and still save about $2,850 per month each, compared to their current default costs. a single municipal customer could still save about $880 per month compared to their current bill if they purchased a blended product at 6.0 cents per kwh. 

what *is* it worth?
what will renewable energy be worth to pittsburgh's families, businesses, institutions and governments? buying renewable is the single best thing any consumer can do to protect our environment and public health. its value is great and its price in pittsburgh will become less distorted with the removal of stranded cost charges from consumers' bills next year. the savings of $20 per month for a typical residential customer and much more for typical commercial, industrial, and municipal accounts, gives pittsburgh a great opportunity to become america's first green-powered city. the price of that opportunity will cost less than what consumers paid for dirty power in 1996 or even what many are paying now. 

the value of that opportunity is priceless.

Thank you for the e-mail.  I tried to contact you on your mobile several 
times in the last few minutes but I cannot get through.  Is there anyone 
besides Lauren who can help us in her absence?  I understand the GDRs were 
purchased and the account must be opened.  We cannot do anything without 
background documentation.  Also, we cannot find any information about the 
purchaser on the Enron corporate workbook.  Do you have a list of 
officers/directors?  You can call me at 713/853-5620.  Regards.  Sara

loaded onto the the international data base. I already have access to this 
data base through Lotus Notes.

The agreed actions were

Tana would arrange for Alison, Rob and myself to have update and view access.
Tana would work with Alison on getting existing Australian ISDAs loaded up 
and explaining functionality.

Tana how are we going with access? We can then get things moving.

Please see the attached comparison of the Phase 6 that we have in the 2002-2006 Plan versus Dave's analysis.

For the Plan, we ran it with and without Phase 6 to determine the incremental change.  The worksheet attached also shows the Returns on Equity and Capitalization (with and without) based on the Plan runs.

You will have a reasonable apples-to-apples if you compare the amounts at the Operating Income level because Dave did not assume how it was financed in his analysis however my depreciation is GAAP but Dave's is Tax.

There are only two significant differences:

1)  For conservatism, Dave used the settled rate rather than the rate refund floor rate in 2004.  In Dave's calculations this made a difference of  about 2.9 cents (77.60 cts vs. 74.71 cts. ) for the customers other than FP&L in 2004.  There is no difference for FP&L because their 2004 rate cap is 74.60 cts, lower than either the settled or rate refund floor rates.  (Per Dave, in the risk analyses the rate refund floor impact WAS included.)

2)  We got a lower Ad Valorem tax estimate from Ted Ryan than what Dave used.

Attached is a brief proposal for economics arguments against the CPUC's 
proposal for load based price caps.  Obviously, these arguments would also

Subject: Motion for Interim Relief by CPUC



Mary:

cc: Ron, Jim

I have had a quick read-through of the CPUC Motion, as requested. There
would appear to be two salient points.

1) CPUC asks for FERC to impose strict load-differentiated price caps. These
would be imposed using a formula based on ""margina1 heat rates"" times an
index gas price. So the maximum cap would be around $100 and the minimum
could be quite low off-peak - more like $30-40/MWh. Needless to say this
does not recognize the opportunity costs of power in other markets. It was
also completely make redundant any trading into California. The prices would
rise immediately to the low caps, so there would be no incentive for anyone
to enter into any commerical hedging arrangements. The mechanism is
basically similar to the old SRAC QF contracts, but without the capacity
payments.

2) CPUC asks that FERC require all jurisdictional generators AND marketers
to offer forwards contracts for a substantial portion of their capacity at
FERC regulated rates and conditionns for 18-36 months. They claim these are
like the UK and Australian ""vesting contracts"", but these involved
significant capacity or options payments as well. CPUC request that all
generators and marketers should be instructed to begin preparation of
cost-based filings (how this would actually work is not stated).

Needless to say the implementation of any of this would be wiping out the
market for up to three years, and eliminating any potential profits from
current long positions in the market.

The schemes they have proposed have numerous problems - even if the
objectives were desirable - so there is plenty to poke holes in. The
decision on whether to file any response to me would seem to be based on
whether these issues will be completely addressed in FERC's order, making
the CPUC Motion irrelevant. If there is any chance that the CPUC could be
taken seriously their motion should be opposed, as the restrictions on the
market are quite onerous. Any players with long positions in the market
would stand to lose quite a bit under the proposed capped rates at these
levels.

",mary.hain@enron.com,"attached is a brief proposal for economics arguments against the cpuc's 
proposal for load based price caps.  obviously, these arguments would also 
apply to the iso board's recent decision.

mary:

cc: ron, jim

i have had a quick read-through of the cpuc motion, as requested. there
would appear to be two salient points.

1) cpuc asks for ferc to impose strict load-differentiated price caps. these
would be imposed using a formula based on ""margina1 heat rates"" times an
index gas price. so the maximum cap would be around $100 and the minimum
could be quite low off-peak - more like $30-40/mwh. needless to say this
does not recognize the opportunity costs of power in other markets. it was
also completely make redundant any trading into california. the prices would
rise immediately to the low caps, so there would be no incentive for anyone
to enter into any commerical hedging arrangements. the mechanism is
basically similar to the old srac qf contracts, but without the capacity
payments.

2) cpuc asks that ferc require all jurisdictional generators and marketers
to offer forwards contracts for a substantial portion of their capacity at
ferc regulated rates and conditionns for 18-36 months. they claim these are
like the uk and australian ""vesting contracts"", but these involved
significant capacity or options payments as well. cpuc request that all
generators and marketers should be instructed to begin preparation of
cost-based filings (how this would actually work is not stated).

needless to say the implementation of any of this would be wiping out the

I was thinking about what to get Dad for Christmas and I think what he would like most is a family portrait.

Joan has talked to Leigh-Leigh Baillio about taking pictures of the family. The sitting fee is $85 (if other family units want pictures it would be an additional $20 per family plus the cost of film). The cost per picture varies by the size and quantity ordered. Joan is getting actual prices from Leigh-Leigh. As a rough estimate, Joan spent about $300 on three 8x10's plus some smaller prints.

I thought we could take the portrait after Jim & Marianna's second baby is born . . . maybe the weekend of her baptism? . . . so there wouldn't be any actual money paid until the Spring. If that's a problem, instead of a Christmas present, we could give him the portrait for a combination father's day/birthday present.

Frank:
I spoke with her attorney yesterday and believe that I addressed her concerns 
with the ETA, GTC and Password Application forms.  She is going to add 
language to the Password Application that makes it clear that any GTC is 
considered to be ""signed"" and ""in writing"" if they are required by the 
Website to click on it.  Her main concern given the fact that we now have a 
Master in place with them is that they are not asked to accept the terms of a 
GTC and I assured her that so long as she has a Master in place that covers 
the product that she wants to trade that they will not be asked to accept a 
GTC.  Anyway, putting this language in the PA seemed to make her feel 
better.  Once you receive the PA from her why don't you fax it to me  and I 
will let you know if it is acceptable.

Also, as I discussed with Stephanie yesterday, they wanted to do a ""test"" run 
on the Website to check to make sure that they would not be asked to accept a 
GTC.  I told her that the only way to do this would be to click on a product 
description once they get their password.  I understand that you and Tana 
will coordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the 
ISDA Master that they executed gets coded into the Website at the proper time 
so that when they do click on a product description, no GTC appears.

Please call me if you have any questions.
